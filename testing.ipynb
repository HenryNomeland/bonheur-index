         "Curated by Tracey Bashkoff and Vivien Greene “THE REIGN OF ORPHEUS IS BEGINNING,” declared the poet-critic Guillaume Apollinaire in his review of the 1913 Salon des Indépendants in Paris. Less a movement than a loose constellation of Parisian painters in the same orbit, Orphism, according to Apollinaire, variously denoted the “art of painting new compositions with elements not taken from reality as it is seen, but entirely created by the artist and invested by him with a powerful reality”; a school of painters who had “arrived at a more internal, less intellectual, more poetic vision of the universe and of life”; and an art of “pure aesthetic pleasure.” This elastic definition, largely articulated in response to exhibitions, could accommodate a range of painters with distinct approaches. Most closely associated with Robert Delaunay’s luminous disks, the Orphist label was also attached to Marcel Duchamp, František Kupka, Fernand Léger, and Francis Picabia, artists who seemed to have little in common stylistically but who shared an interest in pushing their work into the realm of pure abstraction. In fact, by the time of Apollinaire’s pronouncement, the end was already near. Orphism’s supposed adherents mostly denied belonging in the first place, but the onset of World War I the following year put an end to whatever incipient collective spirit the critic discerned in the salons and studios of Paris. For some artists, like Duchamp and Picabia, Orphism was merely a way station they passed through en route to the mature work for which they are best known; others, like Delaunay and Kupka, kept painting in a similar idiom throughout their careers, without ever fully recapturing their prewar momentum. Hence the art-historical problem posed by Orphism: It is impossible to disregard the profound accomplishment of a painting like Kupka’s Amorpha, fugue à deux couleurs (Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors), 1912, or Delaunay’s Premier disque (First Disk), 1913, which rank among the first abstract works exhibited in Europe (First Disk being the most radically nonobjective of its moment), yet it is difficult to pinpoint where that accomplishment led, eclipsed as it was by the antics of Surrealism and Dada, on the one hand, and the architectonic abstraction of De Stijl, Constructivism, and the Bauhaus on the other. As Gordon Hughes points out in his 2014 study of Delaunay, Orphism is the only dead end in Alfred H. Barr Jr.’s infamous genealogy of modernism, the ism that “goes exactly nowhere.” “Harmony and Dissonance: Orphism in Paris, 1910–1930” at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York never quite finds its way out of this quandary. The show opens with the promising suggestion of coherence, presenting a tight grouping of greatest hits. Delaunay’s Soleil, lune, simultané 2 (Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon), 1913, a radiant tondo evoking celestial bodies in orbit, is placed high on one wall, hovering to the side of his wife Sonia Delaunay-Terk’s Prismes électriques (Electric Prisms), 1914, whose banded disks of color were influenced by the electric lamps newly installed on the streets of Paris. Facing the Delaunays are Kupka’s Localisation de mobiles graphiques II (Localization of Graphic Motifs II), 1912–13, a whirling vortex of bladelike forms in a wild palette of fuchsia and emerald, and Picabia’s Edtaonisl (Ecclésiastique) (Edtaonisl [Ecclesiastic]), 1913, a jigsaw arrangement of twisting coils and irregular planes with a suggestively mechanical sheen, supposedly inspired by an encounter with the notorious dancer Stacia Napierkowska. (The seemingly nonsense title is a mash-up of the words étoile and danse.) The paintings are stylistically dissimilar, but the relationship is familial. You can sense, in this room, why Apollinaire instinctively believed these artists belonged together, even if they themselves were not so sure. To begin with the obvious, each one rejected the dour monochrome palettes of Cubism in favor of brilliant color contrasts and traded angular grids for interpenetrating arcs and disks. But the more profound difference from the Cubists in their milieu was a willingness to let go of representation altogether. Though objects and entities in the world might serve as a point of reference, none of these artists—at least at this moment—were interested in depicting it outright, let alone legibly. Instead, they aspired to capture the sensation of light and motion itself, evoked in each of these four paintings through pulsing rhythms radiating from a central node. But as the show proceeds up the Guggenheim’s rotunda, this initial impression of cohesion falls away, pushing the already hazy picture of Orphism in multiple, perhaps irreconcilable directions. Orphism was cast by Apollinaire as a Cubist offshoot (he refers to it initially as “Orphic Cubism” in his 1913 essay collection Les Peintres Cubistes [The Cubist Painters]), but in many respects it was more akin to a Post-Post-Impressionism. Though inflected by Cubism’s decisive break with the model of perspectival illusionism that had reigned since the Renaissance, Orphism ultimately prioritized a more extreme version of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist interest in the optical effects of light and the science of color, in particular the color theories of Michel-Eugène Chevreul, Charles Henry, and Ogden Rood. (The Delaunays were explicit about their debt to Chevreul’s 1839 treatise De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs [Laws of Simultaneous Color Contrasts], which described how the perception of a given color is affected by adjacent hues.) In place of the semiotic play underpinning the Cubism of Picasso and Braque—an exploration of the limit case of representation—or the Salon Cubists’ systematic use of faceting to deconstruct objects in space, the painters affiliated with Orphism focused on optical and perceptual sensation. Hence the art-historical problem posed by Orphism: It is impossible to disregard its profound accomplishment, yet it is difficult to pinpoint where that accomplishment led. In particular, they captured the sensorium of modernity: the dizzying speed of the new Paris Métro, the pulse of electric light at night, the flickering movement of a film strip, all of which seemed to dissolve and penetrate form. Alongside these tangible landmarks of the technological revolution underway were any number of recent scientific discoveries pointing to a teeming world of matter lurking beneath the visible: subatomic particles, radio waves, X-rays. In Delaunay’s earlier Cubist depictions of the Eiffel Tower, 1911–12, two of which are included here, the structure appears as the jagged and fragmented centerpiece of a cityscape, pitched forward and pulled back at once to capture a sense of its vertiginous height. By contrast, in the majestic L’équipe de Cardiff (The Cardiff Team), 1913, based on a newspaper photograph of a rugby match, silhouettes of the tower, the Great Wheel, the athletes’ bodies leaping through the air after the ball, and the spectators cheering them on are all arrayed on the same plane, dissolving any sense of foreground and background to form a kind of interlocking pattern across the surface. Sonia Delaunay’s Le Bal Bullier, from the same year, translates the atmosphere of the Paris dance hall the couple frequented into a prismatic panorama, with dancers performing the tango loosely rendered as serpentine silhouettes, while Picabia’s Culture physique (Physical Culture), 1913, is an even more fully abstract evocation of athletes in motion, the figures altogether absent except as flesh-tone ribbons winding across the canvas. The so-called Orphists were hardly alone in these interests. There is considerable overlap, aesthetically and interpersonally, with not only Cubism but also Futurism and Expressionism, among other, more marginal isms (e.g., Synchromism, Rayonism). Apollinaire’s own idiosyncratic categorization doesn’t help the curators, Tracey Bashkoff and Vivien Greene, in their attempts to define the contours of a movement that no artist really claimed as their own. Kupka, whose work at the 1912 Salon d’Automne was anecdotally reported to be the initial inspiration for the term Orphism, is written out of Apollinaire’s account entirely after he publicly rebuffs the critic’s praise for his work as misguided, while Duchamp’s somber Nu [esquisse], jeune homme triste dans un train (Nude [Study], Sad Young Man in a Train), 1911–12, is explicitly mentioned, despite its total lack of the radiant color whose presence would become Orphism’s defining characteristic. The show’s most important historical contribution is returning Sonia Delaunay to the center of the story. Unmentioned by Apollinaire and long treated as a historical footnote in Robert’s career, she emerges here as the more inventive artist, adopting a transmedial, multidimensional approach to the style she and her husband called simultanéisme in an attempt to make it a truly living art. Accompanying her painting of the Bal Bullier are sketches for one of the “simultaneous dresses” she intended to be worn there, its surface activated through the ecstatic movements of a patron’s dancing body, and the jubilant toy box she designed for her young son. Best of all is the exquisite “simultaneous book” she coproduced with poet Blaise Cendrars, La Prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France (The Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France), 1913, interlacing Cendrars’s fragmentary narrative of a journey on the Trans-Siberian Railroad with Delaunay’s vibrant arcs of color. Printed vertically and bound accordion style, the book displays text and image cascading down the page like a train hurtling through the countryside, culminating in the Eiffel Tower’s diminutive silhouette floating atop the paper’s lower edge. Other inclusions are more questionable. In the show’s second half, in particular, the focus shifts from giving shape to Orphism, as a set of overlapping formal and theoretical concerns among a specific cohort of Parisian artists in the years leading up to World War I, to charting the diffusion of those aesthetics across Europe and the United States. The idea that the Paris-based American painters Stanton MacDonald-Wright and Morgan Russell’s Synchromism was in a semi-rivalrous conversation with Orphism seems convincing enough, despite their loud protestations to the contrary. Less clear is the relevance of a work like David Bomberg’s In the Hold, ca. 1913–14, a hard-edge geometric abstraction organized around an orthogonal grid, inspired by the dock workers in London’s East End, or Alexander Archipenko’s static sculptures of a stylized Pierrot. And what exactly do the curators mean when they say, in a wall label, that Giacomo Balla’s Mercurio transita davanti al sole (Mercury Passing Before the Sun), 1914—a depiction of a specific astronomical event (the transit of Mercury on November 17, 1914) as seen through the artist’s telescope—is “aligned more with Orphism” than with Italian Futurism, the movement to which he avowedly belonged, “if perhaps unwittingly”? For the Delaunays and Kupka in particular, the invocation of simultaneity was not just a matter of rendering the impression of speed and movement through dynamic compositional and formal elements (for instance, Futurist force lines trailing behind a rearing horse or sprinting cyclist), but also the perceptual sensations that the paintings literally produced in the viewer. Somewhere along the line in the exhibition, this more specific concern with exploring how optical effects could be marshaled toward compositional ends is dropped in favor of a more generic understanding of modernist simultaneity as representing the multiplicity of time and space. Here, Orphism comes to mean virtually any instance of an artist exploring colorful abstraction in the teens and beyond, sidestepping the thorny but valuable work of defining what, if anything, set Orphism apart from other, apparently similar tendencies—and if the curators’ answer is Nothing, really, then why call the show “Orphism in Paris” at all? Perhaps ironically, a more or less convincing picture of what Orphism was does ultimately emerge in the exhibition, through comparison with what it is almost certainly not. Marc Chagall’s Hommage à Apollinaire (Homage to Apollinaire), 1913, for example, which sets an angular nude against a spinning colored disk, is self-evidently indebted to Robert Delaunay, but the effect of its broad areas of mottled, opaque color is heavy and emotive where the Delaunays’ works are vibratory and atmospheric. Despite the description of Jean Metzinger’s Danseuse au café (Dancer in a Café), 1912, as “demonstrating an interest in the simultaneity typical of Orphism and Italian Futurism,” its schematic dissection of a café-concert has little in common with Sonia Delaunay’s pulsing Bal Bullier; or Kupka’s Disques de Newton (Étude pour “La fugue à 2 couleurs”) (Disks of Newton [Study for “Fugue in Two Colors”]), 1912, whose title nods to both the structure of music and the science of color, the painting part of a series of works that progressively distill the movement of his stepdaughter’s ball arcing through the air in the family’s garden into pure abstraction. A baffling “coda” featuring postwar works by Albert Gleizes—late canvases that mash together various Cubist and post-Cubist idioms—and his justifiably obscure Irish student Mainie Jellett illustrates not so much Orphism’s vital afterlife as its obsolescence. Not every movement has a hidden transnational, intergenerational history to uncover, or uncannily anticipates the concerns of the present: In their attempts to expand the Orphist orbit, the show’s curators reveal how narrow it actually was. “Harmony and Dissonance: Orphism in Paris, 1910–1930” is on view through March 9.

         "Curated by Emily Weeks, Giles Hudson, and Sara Raza THE FRENCH ARTIST Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) was a phenomenally influential painter. His Orientalist depictions of North Africa, Asia, and Southern Europe—both imitated and derided in his day—made him one of the most widely reproduced and commercially successful European artists of the second half of the nineteenth century. As a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris for forty years, he mentored more than two thousand art students. US patrons extended his influence. Almost two centuries after he transformed the way in which his audiences imagined the Islamic world and other cultures, his lingering impact on how the “East” is represented, in media ranging from fine art and photojournalism to Hollywood films, remains a source of bitter controversy. The bicentennial exhibition “Seeing Is Believing: The Art and Influence of Gérôme,” at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in Qatar’s capital, revisits Gérôme’s art and legacy in three distinct sections. The roughly four hundred works are drawn from Qatar Museums’ national collections, amassed by the gas-rich Gulf emirate over forty years, and loans from institutions ranging from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia. Yet on the twentieth anniversary of Qatar’s ambitious museum-building program, launched in 2005 to diversify the fossil-fuel-dependent economy through investment in the cultural tourism sector, this sprawlingly ambitious show, which claims to provide a “space to critically reassess Gérôme’s influence,” inadvertently undermines the emirate’s credibility as a global center for art. The exhibition in Mathaf, a repurposed school building, was organized by the future Lusail Museum (formerly called the Orientalist Museum), under construction on an island north of Doha. The Lusail’s core collection of nineteenth-century European painting and photography of the MENASA region (Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia) is possibly the world’s largest hoard of Orientalist art—that genre of visual art created mainly in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (especially by French and British artists) that depicted a culturally diverse region conflated as the “Orient” from an outside, often imaginary, perspective. The subject matter of Orientalist art ranged broadly, from desert landscapes to pious prayers at the mosque—both represented among Gérôme’s paintings here. Another popular subject was the harem: Under the influence of Antoine Galland’s early-eighteenth-century French translation of The Thousand and One Nights, harems—women’s private spaces within the home that would have been barred to male artists—were frequently reimagined as bordellos. The power of these made-up images, playing on ignorance, fears, and desires about an “East” against which Europe could define its own identity, persists today. In 2019, Gérôme’s Slave Market, 1866—a composition depicting a turbaned man thrusting his fingers into the mouth of a pale, naked woman as other men look on approvingly—appeared on posters put up by the German far-right Alternative für Deutschland party with the xenophobic slogan “So That Europe Won’t Become Eurabia.” So how is this contentious body of art to be reframed for the twenty-first century, and sense made of the fact that some of the most avid collectors of Orientalist art are in the Arab world? The show’s opening section, “A Wider Lens, A New Gérôme,” curated by the independent Gérôme scholar Emily Weeks, presents the artist’s life and work in a midnight-blue interior redolent of a Paris salon. “Try . . . to forget all the politics that surrounds [these paintings] today,” the curator’s audio guide intones, as we are urged to look closely at the works’ aesthetic appeal and painterly mastery, in what, according to Weeks, is the first museum exhibition to explore Gérôme’s style and technique. He was in his teens at the advent of photography; a photograph here shows him as an imperious figure with a turned-up mustache. As other artists turned to Impressionism—a style he abhorred—he opted for hyper-realism, vying with the new lens-based medium through a technically accomplished academic style of oil painting, using invisible brushstrokes to create a smooth, glassy surface. Inspired by David Roberts and Eugène Delacroix, he used this realism to make neoclassical history paintings. In Pollice Verso (With a Turned Thumb), 1872, a Roman swordsman stands triumphant in an arena with his sandaled foot on a man’s neck while looking to a row of ghoulish women, whose livid faces and downturned thumbs conjure a spectacle of bloodlust. With its immersive drama and almost Technicolor realism, the painting is described by Weeks as a catalyst for Ridley Scott’s 2000 Hollywood blockbuster Gladiator. A map in the first section charts how Gérôme ventured beyond the Grand Tour of Italy and Greece into Turkey, Algeria, Palestine, and Egypt. After each journey, he returned to his Paris studio to paint, creating a signature style that deceived critics and others into believing his paintings were a window onto scenes of daily life he had witnessed. The show emphasizes his seamless studio “bricolage,” which relied for its seeming authenticity on photographs, costumes, and other props—many supplied by his art dealer and father-in-law, Adolphe Goupil, a collector of Islamic art.The same costume from a photograph inspired both Albanian and Egyptian figures in different paintings. Gérôme’s Femme circassienne voilée (Veiled Circassian Lady), 1876, a fair-skinned beauty with a luscious hand pointing toward her cleavage, was a Parisian model. The power of these made-up images, playing on ignorance, fears, and desires about an “East” against which Europe could define its own identity, persists today. In the show, we see how Gérôme’s artistic liberties spawned sensationalist imagery, from La mosquée El Assaneyn, les têtes coupées (The Mosque El Assaneyn, The Severed Heads), 1866, featuring severed heads piled outside a mosque, to Derviches hurleurs/Le Dervish Tourneur (The Whirling Dervish), 1899, with its crazed spectators. Yet portraits of named individuals, such as the sketch of a full-lipped North African or Arab woman, Portrait of a Woman (Aiouch), ca. 1855–56, are displayed to counter criticism of Gérôme’s art as portraying ethnographic types. The relatively few examples here of Gérôme’s many harem paintings are presented as subtle genre paintings of everyday life. Study for Femmes dans un kiosque (The Harem in the Kiosk), ca. 1870–75, depicts women on an outing. The label is worth quoting in full: This study for a finished painting shows Ottoman women of the harem with their children, enjoying the cool breezes off the Bosporus. Though most 19th-century artists depicted harem women as seductive and unclothed odalisques in dimly lit interiors, here Gérôme challenges his contemporaries’ expectations and offers a more modest—and accurate—view of their daily lives. Then what are we to make of the leering guard in the foreground, his face resembling a Guy Fawkes mask, who confronts the viewer with what might be a taunting swagger? While this commentary appears to reposition Gérôme as more truthful than his peers, perhaps his best known and most fantastical paintings—his salacious images of nudes in Turkish baths and white-slave auctions—are absent here. Such works are nevertheless key to Gérôme’s Orientalist oeuvre, in that they unmask the prurient fantasy latent in much of it, and epitomize the lifeless kitsch that led the novelist Émile Zola to scorn him as a “cynical manufacturer of anecdotal images for mass reproduction and popular consumption.” The absence of these works, which cannot be shown in Qatar owing to their nudity and sexual content, suggests the limits to grappling with Orientalism in the Gulf. Back in 2013, when a museum in Doha refused to display two marble statues of ancient Greek male nudes in an exhibition on the Olympics without screening them behind black gauze (Greece’s National Archaeological Museum preferred to ship them back to Athens), the Qatar Museums Authority said the decision was “not due to censorship” but instead was owing to sensitivity “to community needs and standards.” Little appears to have changed. Here, even the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978), with Gérôme’s Le Charmeur de serpent (The Snake Charmer), ca. 1879, on the cover, is partially concealed. Another volume in the same vitrine, Linda Nochlin’s The Politics of Vision (1989), coyly obscures the naked rear of the boy entwined with a serpent in the painting, with its homoerotic charge. While censorship might be downplayed as a periodic challenge to curators anywhere, the contradictions created in an exhibition on Orientalism are overwhelming. The inability to show, or even describe, the more lurid of Gérôme’s works obscures the powerful element of fantasy and projection at play in his art, skewing the art-historical reappraisal—unless visitors are assumed (unreasonably) to have prior familiarity with his oeuvre. Here, his constructed fictions might appear benignly driven by aesthetic choices. The promised “wider lens” has in fact narrowed. Said made no mention of Gérôme, but the critic is implicated in Weeks’s assertion, in her written curatorial statement for the exhibition, that “Gérôme’s style was politicised in the 20th century.” Her audio guide describes Gérôme as the “first victim, perhaps, of Orientalism’s redefinition”: No longer were his paintings “considered an innocent function of his training, then, or a record of truth”; rather they were seen as “evidence of [his] complicity in an imperial plan.” Whatever the cruder claims of those who came after Said, far from “politicizing” such art, Orientalism argued that the production of knowledge, even when apparently neutral, was tainted by power and interests; that ruling others was made possible by the cultural representation of the ruled. Regardless of Gérôme’s motives, or his view of French power, his portrayal of the Orient was undeniably political in its day, not least for those it purported to represent but who did not, at that time, have a voice. Among his recurring subjects were so-called Bashi-bazouks, Ottoman mercenaries—often Albanian or African—who fought against Napoleonic troops in Egypt after the French invasion of 1798, as the waning of the Ottoman Empire opened the way for the French and British to take power. In Fondeur de balles dans un café (Cafe House, Cairo [Casting Bullets]),ca. 1884, Gérôme depicts them at leisure, but their oddly incongruous task, making bullets, would have been a sharp reminder of their reputation as brutish fighters and lawless plunderers. Less revisionist, the show’s second and bracingly forensic section, “Between Gérôme and Photography: Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction,”argues that early-nineteenth-century lithographers anticipated Orientalist painters in disseminating their views of the Orient. Its curator, Giles Hudson, senior curator of photographs for the Lusail Museum, suggests that photography’s “revolution in representation” further transformed what Europeans believed about the Islamic world, partly through the “cartomania” of mass-produced postcards. Masquerading as unmediated reality, these cards, and Gérôme’s painterly illusionism, in a sense presaged the visual deceptions of Photoshopping and deepfakes. Black-and-white photographs were often hand-tinted by artists, with saturated color used to exoticizing effect—its legacy evident in the Magnum photographs on view here. Hudson surmises that Gérôme modeled the background in Le barde noir (The Black Bard), 1888, whose passive face peeps from a salmon-pink robe, on an Abdullah Frères photograph of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, but his invented color scheme offsets the musician’s clothing with a sea of blue-green tiles, using the exaggerated contrasts of a “stereotypical Orientalist palette.” The show’s final section, “I Swear I Saw That,” curated by the independent critic Sara Raza, has twenty-five artists contesting ethnographic “Orientalisms.” A Portrait of Lorna Selim, 1948, an oil painting by the Turkish-born Iraqi modernist Jewad Selim, portrays his wife, a white British artist, with partially covered hair, playing on Orientalist conventions in reverse. Aikaterini Gegisian’s Self-Portrait as an Ottoman Woman with Flowers, 2024, frames found ethnographic postcards with digital collage. Aziza Shadenova’s “Girls of Kyrgyzstan” series, 2011, mocks Soviet Orientalism, whereby Central Asian women were made to exemplify progress under communism. In one absurdist digital photograph from the group, a young woman with billowing hair poses on a bed with a tiger. Hours before the show’s opening in November, Harem, 2009, a video by the Turkish artist İnci Eviner, was removed on the instructions of Qatar’s Ministry of Culture. The work animates and reimagines a nineteenth-century engraving by the French artist Antoine Ignace Melling, also in the show. Eviner’s aim, she wrote, was to “articulate these women beyond being objects of knowledge.” There seems to be no nudity in the video (or the engraving), which has been shown at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the British Museum in London, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art—though one woman might appear to be copulating under a sheet. If state censorship were in deference to putative local sensitivities, some explanation might be expected. None was given. In her photograph Who will make me real?, 2005, Raeda Saadeh hints at how Orientalism’s persistent legacy remains a battleground through her ironic self-portrait as a reclining odalisque, her body papered in Arabic newsprint. Yet the dearth of examples of Gérôme’s odalisques means we are not permitted to see what provoked such work. The final section thus becomes a response, however indirect and wide-ranging, to art that has been rendered invisible and unmentionable. The removal of Eviner’s work, together with the artful concealment of Said’s book cover, makes plain the self-censorship that would have had to govern the entire exhibition—and indeed any curatorial work for Qatar Museums. Said wrote that he had “always been interested in what gets left out.” To attempt a major reevaluation of a leading Orientalist painter without nudes (or frank reference to sexuality) seems as absurdly misconceived as Victorians’ fig-leafed displays. Skirting Gérôme’s most notorious works both infantilizes and hoodwinks the visitor. There are pressing reasons to revisit this artist’s work from robust new perspectives, including the show’s valuable analysis of the ways in which he duped audiences into believing his projected worlds were real. But this was not the place for a convincing reappraisal. Maya Jaggi is a contributing art critic to the Financial Times of London.",

         "This exhibition, honoring Parisian art dealer Berthe Weill (1865–1951), constitutes its subject through far-reaching networks of aesthetic trajectories, mirroring her vision for vanguard experimentation and enterprise. Weill has been largely erased from defining accounts of twentieth-century modern art despite her significant contributions. And so here, she figures variously as a bespectacled, peculiar visage in portraits made by artists in her gallery’s stable; a penetrating voice in generous excerpts from her recently translated autobiography; a chameleonic interlocutor in archival letters; a diminutive but businesslike outlier anchoring photographs of her bohemian cohort; and, above all, the discerning eye tethering the roughly 110 artworks on display. In this presentation-cum-counternarrative, Weill is reinstated as the instinctive maverick who presciently showed Braque, Matisse, Picasso, and Rivera before her male contemporaries picked up the scent. The exhibition opens with sections on Fauvism and Cubism, movements debuted at the dealer’s eponymous Galerie B. Weill, so named to strategically occlude her gender (she had earlier dispensed with her biblical first name, Esther). Beyond the canon, the selection summons examples by lesser-known entities whom Weill supported. Cubist compositions by André Lhote with classicizing undertones signal the gallerist’s acceptance of stylistic unorthodoxy, which her peers, especially Léonce Rosenberg, strove to stamp out. Moreover, a feminist spirit resounds: We learn of exhibitions featuring unsung women avant-gardists such as Alice Halicka, Jacqueline Marval, Suzanne Valadon, and Émilie Charmy, whose prominently placed ca. 1906 self-portrait shares a moment of erotic rapture. Supine with one hand bracing her neck, Charmy closes her eyes as her blue gown slips off, exposing an arched breast. An undercurrent of the exhibition worthy of further consideration is Weill’s palate for paintings of radical womanhood. In Nude with Striped Blanket, 1922, Valadon’s portrayal of her niece gestures toward the adolescent’s growing consciousness of the capabilities of her own body and intellect—the subject is transfixed, thumbing through an open book on an unmade bed, naked. More than a mere presence within a male-dominated sphere, Weill declares a kinship with the subaltern community fomenting around the discourse on women’s autonomy and civil disobedience in widely read feminist journals such as La fronde (The Sling). (The publication was launched in 1897, just four years before Weill opened her first venue.) Better known is the incident in which police raided Weill’s gallery during Modigliani’s solo exhibition there, having been alerted to “indecent” content. Weill and her coconspirator, dealer Léopold Zborowski, had placed a painting of a bawdy odalisque with pubic hair in the space’s window—scandalizing the puritanical psyches of her bourgeois neighbors. The title of Weill’s 1933 autobiography Pan! Dans l’oeil (translated in 2022 as Pow! Right in the Eye) trumpets her sundry provocations. The show’s curatorial team was more direct in correcting the antisemitic refrain that Weill was mercenary and “obsessed with prices.” Pervasively, the exhibition foregrounds her benevolent commitment to financially unviable artists, whose work extended a value she dubbed “success d’estime” (critical respect) and informed her business ethic: “Why persist in handling Jeunes? Shouldn’t I consider switching? No! I would rather eat bricks than do something I disliked.” Following a room showcasing her favored painterly subjects—caged birds and floral still lifes—the loose chronology pivots to a historic section: “The Dreyfus Affair and Antisemitism” assembles caricatures of Jews, circulated by the French press, that exaggerated their physiognomies as monstrous and deformed by greed. At great personal risk, Weill exhibited artworks in support of Alfred Dreyfus (a French Jewish army officer, who, when wrongly accused of treason at the turn of the twentieth century, became a polarizing symbol of French antisemitism) and publicly battled invalidating accounts of her Jewish collectors. The show concludes with details of Galerie B. Weill’s forced closure during World War II, recognizing that a formalist account of Weill that solely celebrates her taste and “fine eye” risks sublimating the very powers that threatened her respectability, stature, and survival. Amid the German occupation of France, she relinquished her business to a non-Jewish friend and endured public scorn—a review of her autobiography used her words to confirm the “defects” of her “Jewish spirit.” Though numerous works that passed through her hands are now so valuable they couldn’t be included in this show, the proprietress died penniless. These palpable absences tear at Weill’s belated emergence, demanding the reassertion of her voice and those of her comrades in obscurity.",

         "Edgar Allan Poe once observed that “there is perhaps no point in the history of the useful arts more remarkable than the fact that during the last two thousand years the world has been able to make no essential improvements in roadmaking.” It bothered him, this fact, the city street so unmodern and outmoded. In 1845 he wondered “if the Gothamites of 3845 will distinguish any traces of our Third Avenue”—that is, whether the streets of tomorrow would be doomed to repeat the forms of yesterday. Such a question haunted “The Street,” an exhibition of twenty-three paintings by eighteen artists, curated by Peter Doig. The show was an excellent gathering of open-ended answers to the riddle of inherited forms. The first answer, the obvious one, was Balthus’s La rue (The Street), 1933—the exhibition’s explicit lodestone—which was borrowed from the collection of New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Alongside many impressive loans, the rarely shown canvas was the clear center, a detail the gallery acknowledged often in its press materials (as did many reviews). Still, how exhilarating it was to see the famous work first—as violent and uncanny, as prurient and prudish, as ever—flanked primarily by School of London painters upon entering the presentation. The placement of Frank Auerbach’s Rimbaud, 1975–76, to its left reminded us that when Rimbaud wrote, “Death without tears, our active daughter and servant, a desperate love, and a pretty crime crying in the mud of the street,” he was anticipating the violence intimated by—or at least perceived in—the pair grappling under the streetlamp in La rue. Balthus’s work was then the thesis around which Doig positioned a series of increasingly strong antitheses, the clearest of which was his own Lions (Ghost), 2024, the other prominent piece in this two-room show. Rendered in muted Fauvist fuchsias and blood orange—a Collioure palette highlighted by the boats ashore in the background—the painting alludes heavily to Caravaggio’s Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, ca. 1608. (Imagine Larry Gagosian reaching out to the Archdiocese of Malta to personally secure that loan.) Doig borrows freely from the work’s architectural framing as well as from its brutality: The artist’s two figures appear faintly in the carnelian beachscape, recast perhaps as young lovers wrestling in the sand. One is pinned by the other, with Doig mirroring the act by placing a pair of lions in the foreground, their bodies caught between play and aggression, representing a similar teasing or terrorizing with its own degree of sexual promiscuity. (Studies in the annex revealed how adroit Doig can be in capturing the subtexts of a turned tail.) Famously, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist is also Caravaggio’s only signed work—his name is written out in the martyred saint’s blood. Rarely are authorship and violence so neatly entwined. Much of the remaining violence here was anonymous. We saw little hints of it in the precarious objects painted by Vija Celmins—a space heater, a portable stove on which eggs are frying—and in the barricaded facades of Martin Wong. His Untitled (Poetry Storefront), 1986, turns a Loisaida bodega into a meditation on sanctioned and unsanctioned language: the sign, the placard, graffiti. A similar interest in text (and texture) emerged in Satoshi Kojima’s Far away, 2024, where a subway platform becomes a three-tiered landscape for isolation, or possibly for rendezvous. In another work by Kojima, Underground (Smoke), 2024, two pallid and atmospheric faces—like those in the background of Far away—breathe into each other’s open mouths, the mist condensing on the train-station grating below. If Lions (Ghosts) and La rue were the antitheses of the show, then Kojima’s paintings were its sublation. Perhaps this was why the works appeared in neither gallery but rather hung between the two spaces. Like all streets, Kojima’s subwayscapes share that essential semiprivate, semipublic frisson, a quality Poe overlooked but one Doig and his assembled painters certainly understood. But then, Poe didn’t live long enough to see his nineteenth-century streets rebuilt with steel.",

         "Art writing is a terrible way to make money. By and large, so is artmaking. Anyone who’s good at math would tell you to at least apply some basic max-min logic to either process: Maximize your income while minimizing your output. Of course, that’s the kind of shortsighted cynicism people come to the art world to escape—or is it? You could argue it’s one of our basic instincts. We have so many expressions in praise of winnowing—of separating the wheat from the chaff, skimming the cream off the top, filtering out the noise. And from these clichés we’ve distilled even more words: sorting, screening, refining, purifying, condensing, et al. The word critic comes to us from an ancient root that means “to sift,” and the word tabloid began life as a trademark for pills and soon became a synonym for newspapers with short, condensed, easy-to-digest articles—encapsulations, if you will (and you will). Damien Hirst might have cornered the market on pharma-aestheticals, but for my money Cary Leibowitz has refined the skill of encapsulating art and meaning right down to the picogram. In a pair of shows at New Discretions and Tibor de Nagy, Leibowitz did what he does best by splicing together the simplest of shapes, the prettiest of colors, and the pithiest of aphorisms to create a kind of super-condensed pictographic language, an idiolectal lingua franca as fun and easy to read as a child’s ABC. In fact, aspiring art writers could do worse than study Leibowitz’s cheeky, punchy, and mordant style, exemplified by the complementary (though not complimentary) titles of the two solo exhibitions, his first since Covid-19: at Tibor de Nagy “You Haven’t Changed at All” and at New Discretions “You Really Let Yourself Go.” The shows were thronged with epithets and epigrams, mostly wistful and bemused. We saw plenty of tart flagellations, too—of Leibowitz himself as well as other artists and their audiences, or, more abstractly, of me, us, you, and them. They were like high-concept epitomes of Paul Lynde’s epic zingers from Hollywood Squares (Q: “Paul, the great writer George Bernard Shaw wrote, ‘It’s such a wonderful thing—what a crime to waste it on children.’ What was it?” A: “A whipping.”) For the most part, the shows’ forty-two pieces (twenty-eight at ND and fourteen at TDN) were executed in Leibowitz’s trademark format: precision-cut wood panels in familiar shapes, emblazoned with the artist’s Laugh-In–esque handwriting. They were all done in monochrome latex “straight out of the can,” according to the artist, the method a visual analogue of the playful candor that echoed throughout every work. Each piece was inscribed with its title: A baby-blue cutout anana from 2024 readCRY ME A PINEAPPLE. A two-tone half-capsule shape, also from 2024, read I’VE GOT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY / SAY IT ALREADY. Complications were slight, as in the tweaked-out grade-school diptych Coward/Chicken, 2024: One red cutout of a cow featured the word CHICKEN in yellow, while a lemon-hued silhouette of a chicken read COWARD in green. No doubt the very existence of such punctuated persiflages skipping colorfully and blithely around gallery walls might have seemed tone blind. Should Leibowitz be exercising his wrists, writs, and wits in his familiar navel-gazing way, fiddling while home burns? For all their irreverence of politics—evidenced, for example by a 2022–23 sheepdog cutout that read VOTE FOR CAROL CHANNING—many of these deceptively “lite” works were subversive and deep, carrying coded, tragicomic, and contradictory messages. The artist had his first solo exhibition at Stux Gallery in New York thirty-five years ago—he was queer avant la lettre and cartoony avant l’émoji, making his extended-release formulations timeless. Laughter isn’t the best drug for everything, but we’re going to need a lot of it during this next phase of the apocalypse. Despite claims to the contrary, art doesn’t always have the best sense of humor. Thank god Leibowitz does.",

         "This beautifully selected and flawlessly installed exhibition offered a focused survey from a critical decade in Sylvia Plimack Mangold’s career. Thoughtfully grouped across three successive rooms were ten paintings and drawings produced between 1975 and 1984, ranging from the artist’s early compositions with tapes and measures to her later renderings of landscapes and trees. The intimate, unhurried staging felt just right for a body of work grounded in close and sustained study of the world at hand. Yet the show also made a compelling case for a full-scale retrospective: Astoundingly, three decades have passed since the painter’s last museum survey, held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (now the Buffalo AKG Museum) in 1994. Taped Over Twenty-Four-Inch Exact Rule on Light Floor, 1975, is a modestly sized portrayal of ordinary linoleum tiles viewed head-on and receding evenly in space. Laid down in smooth acrylic layers, the paint itself is tile-like, with tangible interstices between the individual slabs. A cream-colored band of trompe l’oeil tape, also with satisfyingly tactile edges, runs the full width of the canvas along the lower bound and wraps around the corners. (Because viewers entering the gallery approached this painting from its left profile, a torn-looking extremity provided one’s first intimation of the otherwise frontal image.) Subtly underscoring the literal physicality of the support, the precisely rendered adhesive equally draws us into the realm of painterly illusion. The doubleness registers as decidedly post-Minimalist, while the specific placement of the tape highlights the specially charged nature of the work’s bottom edge. The primary threshold between the image and its beholder is at once a caesura and a relational seam. By contrast, three additional works in the opening room showed Plimack Mangold largely emptying out the compositional center in favor of variously painted internal frames, as if to redistribute pressure along the edges. Yet for all their meticulous craftsmanship, the frames themselves were notably irregular and often appeared poignantly makeshift, suggesting the variously overlapping and abutting tape’s function not simply as sly conceptual device, but also as deliberately understated expressive scaffolding, keenly attuned to different intuitions and dispositions. The faux bois effect with masked borders in Untitled, 1975, is of a different thickness along each edge, while the decidedly painterly bands and wavering strokes limning the periphery of Thirty-Six-Inch Closeness, 1976, give way to a precisely rendered ruler along the work’s right margin. Related asymmetries enliven Four Coats, 1976, in which two laterally aligned rulers flank an internal frame of depicted tapes. The measure to the right seems securely held in place, flush with the surface, while the one to the left appears precariously attached: Note the single band of tape in the lower left corner and the subtle foreshortening of the numerals, as well as the dark line running the length of the ruler’s inside edge, suggesting the object is tipped slightly in space. Such displacements read as responsive to the loss of the givenness of framing to painting after Abstract Expressionism—as if the boundary between the work and the world around it must now be improvised edge by edge and joint by joint, with an exactitude rooted equally in observation and invention. Four Coats reveals another singularity: Whereas the internal frames of Untitled and Thirty-Six-Inch Closeness each delimit an otherwise bare support, the canvas-hued heart of Four Coats is emphatically painted, as noted by the title and emphasized by the sage-green underpainting peeking out around the tape. This reactivation of the center constituted a throughline in the exhibition’s two remaining rooms. In the middle gallery, a pair of works on paper from March and April 1975 (Paint the Tape, Paint the Paper, Paint the Tape and Painted Graph Paper,respectively) similarly charged the space within the variously masked bounds—even as that pictorial content amounts, paradoxically, to painstakingly re-created images of blank or largely empty paper supports. Only in the final gallery, containing four compositions, did the framing structures encompass views of the outside world. The installation led us from a pencil-and-acrylic-on-paper portrayal of a prospect from a specific window (Untitled, 1977) to a ravishing, much larger depiction of a stand of trees within a gently rolling landscape (A September Passage, 1984). In these works, taping is fully assumed as a metaphor for the mind at work, circumscribing aspects of the visible and remaking reality as painted form.",

         "Jessie Henson’s exquisite abstractions—materially dense and elaborately wrought compositions made from rayon and polyester threads sewn onto large paper fragments, occasionally adumbrated with paint or gold leaf—are chimeric, as Chimera (Shield) and Chimera (Protection) (all works 2024) make clear. Of course, they are not depictions of the fire-breathing female monster with a lion’s head, goat’s body, and serpent’s tail of Greek mythology, but hallucinations, illusions, even delusions of the most spectacular stripe. These heroically scaled aspides—both about five by three and a half feet—are covered with twenty-four-karat gold, perhaps suggesting how valuable they are to Henson. Yet they appear fractured, as though these objects are remnants that fell from ancient masterpieces, or vestiges of a once rich and formidable civilization. Chimera (Mirror) is a radiantly liquid thing—like a rippling, gilded vista from paradise, with hints of emerald, blue, and pink. It may allude to Jacques Lacan’s theory that a child of roughly six to eighteen months old conceives of himself as a whole entity, an “I,” when gazing upon his reflection in a mirror. Henson’s “looking glass,” however, reflects nothing at all—especially not a sense of her own unified self. It seems to me that the composition has an apotropaic function, as the aforementioned pieces subtitled Shield and Protection strongly suggest. Apotropaic is the Greek word for something “created to thwart evil”—I believe that nonobjective artworks, from Wassily Kandinsky’s to Henson’s, have such a function: to ward off what the Russian painter called “the whole nightmare of the materialistic attitude, which has turned the life of the universe into [a] purposeless game.” Yet abstract art has for some time now felt relatively pointless. Its transcendent aims have been perverted and subverted, made “tasteful,” empty, soulless: Charles Baudelaire would have characterized this change as “positivist” rather than “imaginative.” This depressing shift in Weltanschauung and aesthetics is perhaps most tragically epitomized by Donald Judd’s banal boxes. Henson is attempting to resurrect an emotionally and spiritually resonant form of abstraction—her radiant palette, particularly her heavenly blues, communicate this effect through their wounded, archaic quality. Her exceptional, defensive works show that abstract art has become a broken shadow of itself—a relic to be rescued from oblivion by way of excavating its remains. “I use an industrial sewing machine to draw with thread on paper,” Henson writes on her website. “As thread accrues, tension begins to overwhelm the paper, warping its surface into furrows and waves that result in an undulating, topographical surface”—though I’d describe it as more of an agitated surface. “Wild bursts of color penetrate the stillness of the paper. . . . Colors serve as the base of different emotional states of mind,” she says. Her statements make me think of Kandinsky’s remark that “color is a means of exerting a direct influence upon the soul.” “These works are about the complexity of interior worlds,” she goes on to explain. “The thread is so thin and humble, but surprisingly strong when the strands build up together. The accumulation becomes an act of putting on armor, building up strength.” Thus, the two Chimeras that I discuss here are indicative of what the artist calls her “striving for cohesion”—that is, integration. It is clearly a never-ending, lifelong project—the pursuit of integrity and authenticity, or, as psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott would have described it, the pursuit of the true self. This search may indeed be a chimera. Henson restores nonobjective painting to a more genuine space through her own radical subjectivity, indicating how fundamental emotional conflict is to the vitality of abstract aesthetics.",

         "So-called outsider art is commonly valued for its idiosyncratic character and an originality of spirit—and therefore of form—unspoiled by convention. And yet, truth to tell, much of what is presented under this rubric looks remarkably similar. Singular inventors at the level of, say, Helen Rae or Martín Ramírez are as rare in this realm as they are in the domain of academically trained professionals. But to bend familiar tropes and traditionsto recognizably personal ends is also the mark of a genuine artist. To their number we can now add Franne Davids (1950–2022), whose work Ricco/Maresca presented to the public for the first time in a solo booth at the Art Dealers Association of America’sArt Show at New York’s Park Avenue Armory and, immediately afterward, in a full-scale exhibition of six large canvases and fifteen works on paper at the gallery’s Chelsea space. The paintings (all untitled and made between 1979 and 2018, but not individually dated) featured constellations of women, exotically garbed and sporting elaborate headgear, crowded into densely patterned nonrepresentational environments. I couldn’t help but think of the all-female worlds conjured by English spirit medium Madge Gill or self-taught Algerian painter Baya, who was championed by Picasso and the Surrealists in postwar Paris. Davids’s relentless mark-making might recall the horror vacui that is so common among the art of outsiders—Adolf Wölfli being a prime example, as is Gill. But there is something fundamentally different from such artists’ methods in Davids’s painting process, and therefore in her works’ surfaces: She does not treat her canvas as a simple plane to be filled laterally with adjacent marks or color notes; instead, she works in depth, building up layer after layer, endowing her compositions with a rare chromatic richness and the sense that every aesthetic decision has been deeply contemplated, rather than being the product of some psychic automatism. Some of the works on paper, which appeared to be studies or sketches, showed Davids’s method clearly, with figures broadly adumbrated but minus specific details—which is to say, the images were composed as wholes, not as concatenations of parts. With one exception, the large paintings at the gallery had no evident narrative content. Rather than illustrating actions, they presented gatherings of figures—as if the members of some fantastical court had assembled for their group portrait. In the one canvas that was somewhat different, a woman on the left—apparently unclothed, since the entirety of her white body lacked the lush ornamental patterning of the costumes worn by other characters—knelt before a pair of upright ceremonious beings on the right, with some kind of unidentifiable structure (an altar?) between them. The small works on paper were more various in subject. A couple were absent figures altogether, describing instead the kind of architectural settings in which Davids’s protagonists might be placed. The show also contained more fanciful, lighthearted tableaux: One featured a human posing between a pair of snowmen, while another presented a blue phantom riding what appears to be a giant white cat. Whoever Davids’s women are, they seem tremendously important, existing only to display their grandeur. For some reason I kept thinking of the orientalizing illustrations of the story of Queen Esther—the biblical heroine who saved the Jews of Persia—I’d seen in old books in childhood. Davids, who was Jewish, might well have seen similar imagery. But what she specifically had in mind we may never know; the gallery website mentions “writings—journal entries, letters never sent, and prose poems,” but these were inadvertently destroyed by her relatives. In any case, this artist, who was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic—but was enabled by her family to paint out her visions in the privacy of their Connecticut basement—knew that her art had value. She would sometimes abscond from the domestic nest and make her way to New York, where she was sure the Museum of Modern Art was hoarding paintings it had stolen from her. I wouldn’t be surprised if they turn up there someday, legitimately acquired.",

         "Five cotton textilesby Miranda Fengyuan Zhang took viewers on a trip up the Hudson River, out of New York City, past the Catskills, and into Canada. Marking a subtle departure from the artist’s previous weavings—which feature more boisterous palettes, biomorphic forms, and unruly threads fuzzing out from their surfaces—the works in Zhang’s exhibition at C L E A R I N G, “You can always tell when a lake is coming up, because the mountain would start looking blue,” appeared cool and aloof, serious and unsentimental. On a wall to the left of the gallery’s entrance was On Amtrak Along the Hudson River (all works 2024), a piece that depicts a row of aged fluorescent lights inside an airless tunnel. Owing to the perspectival succession of right angles describing the underpass, which lent a sense of severity and order to the composition, and to the slightly wavering handwoven lines of gray, blue, purple, and yolky yellow, On Amtrak evoked high speeds and anticipation—a claustrophobic commute preceding the hike and the swim. Zhang’s works seemed to obey their internal grids while retaining a pleasantly all-too-human arrhythmic quality. In spirit, they had more in common with the wan, postcardlike aesthetics of Luigi Ghirri’s photographs than with the geometric designs of Anni Albers’s modernist textiles. In the five-by-three-foot On Lake Taghkanic, the largest piece on view, one found an insinuation of the blue mountain mentioned in the show’s title. It was presented as a series of flat-gray triangles, clipped and refracted across three registers, which seemed to absorb the cool tones of the teal threads bearing down on them from the edges of the picture. Displayed like a triumphant memento from Lake Taghkanic, a state park in the Catskill region, the image of the peak was angular and austere. Yet it also seemed to be fading into the atmosphere, eager to disappear. The charcoal-colored boulders in an adjacent work, Mountain Var. III, were likewise fragmented, their scattered parts occluded behind vertical bands of plum and peach. What united these landscapes was the sense that they were observed not by a seasoned camper with a love for nature, but by a vacationer who dutifully traced the top of a range with her eyes before looking down at her watch. These works embraced both the sublime and the workaday in equal measure, shuttling cleverly between the two competing modes of life and feeling. Lakes appeared in two other weavings, Young Glenn on Lake Simcoe and A Pathway on Water. The former is a tribute to the unorthodox twentieth-century classical pianist Glenn Gould, whose summer home was located on the titular site in Ontario. In this piece, Zhang placed a tricolor seed-shaped form, perched like a diver on the edge of a floating plank, in the center of a checked and striped picture plane. She then split the abyss around it down the center, raising the left half of the composition ever so slightly above the right, extinguishing any pictorial illusion of depth. In the latter, a dark narrowing path—shaped like the long shadow of a wine bottle—extends over horizontal bands of liquescent teal and sandy brown toward a fortress with a semicircular gate. Where one would have expected to see the lake depicted from the shore, Zhang captured the view of someone standing on the water, glancing back at the land and the edifices constructed upon it. All throughout the exhibition, walls and vistas were properly conflated: The great outdoors seemed to have been swallowed up by the great indoors.",

         "The photograph is a thing haunted: a ghostly membrane, historically of mirror and metal, then paper, and now an object that glows spectrally from the palm of one’s hand. It is a contradiction: an apparition of occult grandeurthat on occasion becomes a document of whopping cultural heft. The photograph is both manifestation and evidence, simultaneously legible and inscrutable. Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa leverages this paradox of the photograph, reveling in its numinous and ideological characteristics, its status as both enigma and rhetoric. This meticulous exhibition, a deft curatorial effort by the George Eastman Museum’s Phil Taylor, is a bicameral dialogue that features a luminous white chamber, complete with white carpeting, and its opposite, a much darker space that functions as a black mirror. Upon entering this presentation, one feels swaddled in the theatrics of the showroom, aware of the photograph as a gleaming and seductive object. Wolukau-Wanambwa—an artist, essayist, and educator—calibrates a unique conversation around the found promotional picture, which he pairs with his own subtle and often melancholic prints, taking us through issues of history, race, class, and social value. The result is not a duality but a Möbius loop of the theoretical and the ethereal. Inside the white room, one is saluted by kempt, 2023, an elegant depiction of administrative desk signage, emblazoned with a cheerily anachronistic message: THE ATTENDANT WILL BE HAPPY TO ASSIST YOU. Prompted by a wall text, the visitor becomes flaneur: THE VIEWER’S OWN PRIVATE PRACTICE OF LOOKING IS SOLICITED BY THESE WORKS. Commanding the space is Shirley Temple in Dimples (1936), 2018, a poster-size print of the titular child star, a squeaky burlesque of snake-oil charisma, surrounded by white actors in blackface—a racist farce of disturbing legacy in American entertainment. Then there is stain, 2022, a photo of a stone inscription that reads PLACE, executedin a Germanic font and mounted flush to the top of a low platform. It is a memorial object, a picture as tomb. Among the dozen other photos on display is one of a bemused Bing Crosby, the dreamer of a white Christmas, framed on a wall behind patterned rolled glass, as though he were a movie attendant for the caliginous space nearby. Passing into this area, one first encounters (w)hole, 2021, a reticent picture of a circular opening, like a box-office portal, cut into a splotched sheet of glass overlapping an ambiguous, soft-focus image. This porous transition—from surface to picture and back—seems emblematic of the entire exhibition, and this shift is most extravagantly realized in cut, 2024, a one-way mirror linking the two galleries (the reflective side is in the white room, while the transparent side is in the black one, allowing us to see the inside of the white space). This piece, a startling compression of the pictorial mirror/window metaphor, is consistent with show’s takes on surveillance. VIEWERS ARE ALERTED TO THE PRESENCE OF CAMERAS WITHIN THE EXHIBITION SPACE: TO ENTER THE GALLERIES IS TO BE OBSERVED, reads one sign. Throughout, the exhibition depicts various skins of the material world—the surface of history is a facade whose layered veneer conceals a tomb of inconvenient narratives that, indeed, surface. The image is fugitive: It appears and disappears, is reclaimed and lingers. Don DeLillo suggests that “a photograph is a universe of dots. The grain, the halide, the little silver things clumped in the emulsion. Once you get inside a dot, you gain access to hidden information, you slide inside the smallest event.” Wolukau-Wanambwa’s show provides a masterful slide into this universe, whose reflective surface radiates light while refracting history.",

         "The Upper Midwest was once a sprawling habitat of Indigenous wetlands, first lost to colonial settlement, then to modern agricultural development. Today, wetland banks—engineered ecosystems created through market trading that allows developers to buy credits to offset their destruction of wetlands located elsewhere—offer controversial ecological solutions while also obfuscating the region’s Indigenous past. This complex history informs Hydrologic Unit Code 071200—Nibi Ezhi-Nisidawaabanjigaade Ozhibii’igeowin 071200, 2022, a five-channel video installation by Andrea Carlson, made in collaboration with artist Rozalinda Borcilă, that loops footage of Chicago-area wetland banks, road signs, maps, and running text in stacked bands evoking horizons. The work takes its title from a government coding system that became the prototype for wetland banking, thus linking territorial confiscation, capitalism, and problematic forms of environmental mitigation. The result is a multilayered panorama that further complicates narratives of westward expansion and injustices to the region’s Native lands, one of many related themes explored across Carlson’s small but forceful show “Shimmer on Horizons.” Throughout her diverse practice, Carlson (who is of Grand Portage Ojibwe/European descent) combines histories of dispossession and destruction with images of Indigenous presence and renewal in landscapes simultaneously real and invented. Inspired by the terrain of her native Minnesota, Anishinaabe storytelling, and popular culture and film, the artist realizes her reimagined vistas in a variety of media, including this exhibition’s one sculpture and four paintings. The layered strata of Carlson’s video give way in her two-dimensional works to rectangular panes of heavyweight cotton paper. Each one contains a cacophony of images—ranging from shorelines and mounds to animals and flora to masks and cowrie shells—arranged in tiered rows to form one large painting. Carlson’s symbolic motifs are rendered in oil, acrylic, gouache, ink, colored pencil, and graphite, all of which remarkably retain the mark of the artist’s hand despite their collage-like overlays and repeated appearances across multiple compositions. Other iconography is at times more opaque and personally derived, as in Cast a Shadow, 2021, which features floating idols or dolls and, at its center, a stone tower. The latter is a memorial image created by Ojibwe painter and sculptor George Morrison (1919–2000), whom the work commemorates. Perpetual Care, 2024, also pays homage to legacies of Indigenous art, including that of Carlson’s great-aunt, whose drawing of a white horse the artist appropriates while representing herself as a pair of hands. These themes of cultural ancestry and resilience counter the work’s darker connections to racial stereotyping, suggested by the words MONDO CANE (the title of a 1962 Italian documentary that depicts Indigenous and other rituals as “savage”) inscribed within the painting. Perpetual Genre, 2024, is part of the artist’s ongoing “Vore” series, started in 2008, which recasts objects from museum collections and elements from “cannibal boom” films (à la Mondo Cane) into imaginary, often more stylized landscapes. Here, two statues—one Roman, the other from the sixteenth century—depict figures eating human flesh in front of a foreboding seascape. Each is framed by an oculus and surveying equipment, instruments of territorial conquest deployed as symbols of cultural consumption and theft. Carlson extends her filmic references by constructing her compositions on a quasi-cinematic scale; the individual panels mimic film cells, lending her narratives a sense of movement. The artist creates an engaging push-pull between parts and wholes, centers and borders that envelop the viewer while denying any singular point of access or view. This strategy is purposeful, disrupting conventions of Euro-American landscape painting and photography by shunning static, idealized vistas devoid of human presence. Instead, Carlson imbues her fragmentary tableaux with Indigenous histories and Native identities, performing an act of artistic reparation that rights the past and envisions a more sovereign future.",

         "Saint Agatha’s martyrdom was gratuitously macabre; Francesco Guarino’s 1637–40 painting Saint Agatha depicts her pressing a cloth against her bleeding chest. At fifteen, she had her breasts severed as punishment for rejecting the advances of Quintianus, a Roman prefect, after he imprisoned her in a brothel, where she was raped and tortured. (Her piety and modesty, we are told, made her incorruptible.) Sometimes all one can do in the face of such horror is laugh . . . and yet Tacita Dean has made a career of unraveling such histories with a cunningly gimlet eye—through film, photography, painting, printmaking, and other mediums—over the past forty years. Typical of Dean’s slant feminism, the Agatha on display in the artist’s solo exhibition “Blind Folly” is more debaucherous than devout. “Attributes of Sainthood: miracles associated with St Agatha,” 1993, is a series of framed tableaux taken from the artist’s A6 Daler-Rowney pads. Here, we meet a stylized version of the saint across several “acts.” In one scene she is reimagined as a prima donna bound with rope; elsewhere, as a dominatrix named Aphrodesia, sporting calf-high boots and brandishing a whip. Our heroine is ultimately martyred by an ice-cream scoop following the explosion of what appears to be Mount Etna. But despite her trials, and true to her hagiography, the artist assures us that Agatha managed to keep her “flaming virginity” intact until death.Nearby, another drawing, My Feminist Foot, 1991, offers a more cogent meditation on violence. The titular appendage, belonging to the artist, is hideously battered, rendered in a bruisy palette of red, yellow, and green. The work illustrates the kind of suffering one endures for their beliefs; it also evidences the corporal abuses that women more commonly endure today. Dean has an uncanny knack for positioning us within her own perspective. Comprising twenty-five black-and-white photogravures, T & I,2006, presents an austere drama in which the viewer and the artist constitute the work’s namesake protagonists. Together, we overlook a bleak landscape, full of bogs, swamps, lakes, and islands, occasionally illuminated by crepuscular rays of sunlight. A stage direction, ENTER LEFT, is inscribed into the first image; the abbreviation PM—perhaps signaling the westward angle of light emitted by the sun, pitched past noon—appears later. This installation, roughly eleven by fourteen feet, is cinematic in scale and effect. But it is also a surgical dismantling of “the sublime” that indicates the artist’s bias toward postmodernist interventions. I was surprised to learn that this is Dean’s first major museum show in the States, but perhaps I shouldn’t be; I can think of no better institution to contextualize her work than the Menil. Many of her large-scale paintings on view resemble those of her former teacher Cy Twombly, whose compositions are on permanent display in one of the Menil’s dedicated galleries. The brushy green-and-white reliefs that characterize some of Dean’s mixed-media-on-found-slate paintings—including Blind Folly, Green Folly, Hooker’s Green, and Wind-worms, all 2024—are close approximations of her mentor’s Untitled (A Painting in Nine Parts), 1988, which he made in Rome.The two have also examined Greek and Roman mythology throughout their oeuvres (Twombly’s Untitled [Say Goodbye, Catullus, to the Shores of Asia Minor], 1994, ushers the titular poet into the afterlife via scribbled interventions on bipartite canvases, similar to the serial elaborations that constitute both Dean’s “Attributes of Sainthood” and T & I). Yet what separates her work from Twombly’s, and from that of other artists who have taken on similar themes and subjects, is how she humanizes the romantic ideals that aggrandize such legends. Twombly’s Untitled (A Painting in Nine Parts) features a quote by Rainer Maria Rilke—AND IN THE PONDS BROKEN OFF FROM THE BLUE SKY MY FEELING SINKS, AS IF STANDING ON FISHES—which hints at the futility of lofty ambitions. But Dean illustrates the consequences of failing to heed one’s better judgments: The phrase SNAIL TRAIL, faintly inscribed onto Blind Folly’s surface, references the airy teal loops and swirls that decorate the frame, likening them to the slimy paths left by a mollusk. They outline a profile of a woman crying, perhaps over some misfortune caused by her own foolishness, embodying a grief only mortals ever know.",

         "In “Peripheral Gestures,” Rodrigo Valenzuela expanded notions of the photographic to address the possibilities and limits of communication that can exist beyond language. Accompanied by a handful of striking physical sculptures, a series of medium-scale photographs depicted mysterious physical installations that presented as remnants of alien, obsolete, or long-forgotten subcultures. In his series “Garabatos” (Scribbles) (all works 2024), stark black-and-white photographs depict sculptural constructs arranged within small interior spaces. Resembling abandoned stage sets or laboratories, the contents of these chambers range from the organic to the machinelike. The staged images’ multiple sculptural components, made of plaster-like material and mostly irregular in shape, were supported by thin metal rods and in some instances are interconnected with other elements. Abstracted allusions to living forms and mechanical apparatuses, they invited disparate projections and speculations by viewers, without making their intended functions apparent. In Garabato #9, for instance, a round figure—resembling a large alembic, a clay oven, or a roly-poly creature—is posed on a metal stand, while a flattened, frond-like tube trails out a hole in its side and reaches across the floor. Garabato #5, meanwhile, shows a snake-shaped tail running like an electric cord from the lower end of an upright vertebrae-like armature, while Garabato #13 depicts a device made of multiple rings, evocative of medical gear. The purpose of each object remained unclear—they seemed to stand at the ready, primed for reactivation or expired past any further utility. Contrasting with those brightly lit scenes, other photographs from the series depicted sculptural forms mostly cast in shadows, punctuated by sharply defined lighting of a single circular spotlight (Garabato #21) or slats of light as if from partially opened doorways (Garabato #23)—generating atmospheres evoking vintage horror B movies. Arid and macabre, Garabato #18, shows a pelvic bone–like element suspended prominently in the upper middle of the composition, while Garabato #2 and Garabato #20 feature what seem to be near-complete human rib cages. As if erupted from those still tableaux to manifest defiant mischievousness, the show’s other primary body of work, “Muecas” (Grins), comprised five small-scale ceramic sculptures on two dark-colored, waist-high plinths—recalling the presentation style of archaeological remains at a museum. Molded in slightly rough, matte, bone-like white, these sculptures mainly consisted of representations of human hands, with other bodily elements occasionally extruding or intervening—a stray tongue or more ambiguous members with the pieces’ petrified appearance suggesting ancient ritual objects embalmed in lava flows. An extended middle finger gestures in Mueca #5—a punkish fuck you, while other ambiguously modern gestures included heavy-metal devil’s horn signs (Mueca #7) and, more timelessly perhaps, a notched digit between two others at the end of the hand in Mueca #8, suggesting uninhibited masturbatory impulses. Unlike the dormant scenes of the Garabatos, the moments captured in the Muecas, with their mash-ups of multiple fragmented body parts caught mid-gesture, are imbued with great dynamism. Each ceramic surface is elaborately inscribed with small ideographs, markings reminiscent of Mesoamerican codices, Nazca Lines, or petroglyphs, seemingly decipherable but not quite. Here, they represented attempts at communication, even if they weren’t fully successful communicators of actual meaning themselves. Jouissance permeated this exhibition, but something impotent or forlorn was also present—replete with the ghostly debris of obsolete cultural artifacts or remains of humans no longer living or reachable. The Muecas’ contrary or edgy gestures served, as the show’s overarching title suggested, as passing alternatives to or protests against dominant cultural narratives, which might have been seen as residues of subcultural movements relegated to the peripheries of any mainstream. The Muecasread as products of an expired set of cultural understandings shared only by forgotten participants in no longer surviving groups. The restive but perhaps obsolete ideas and attitudes asserted by the various Muecas (implied as well by the deactivated apparatuses in Garabatos) foregrounded ideas of what might lapse and become overlooked as communicative possibility, or what might possibly reemerge out of neglected backroom spaces of cultural activity.",

         "Los Angeles easily tangles into orgies of fantastic possibilities. In “Sci-Fi, Magick, Queer L.A.: Sexual Science and the Imagi-Nation” at the Fisher Museum of Art at USC, curators Kelly Filreis and Alexis Bard Johnson set the scene by providing visitors with a dense, purple infographic that details the webs of kinship and connection among the sci-fi/fantasy proto-cosplayers, queer liberationists, and “magick with a K” esotericists of Los Angeles. During the late 1930s, gay liberationist Harry Hay, later a Radical Fairy, played organ at Gnostic Mass for the Thelemites at the Agape Lodge, where magician Aleister Crowley teamed up with NASA Jet Propulsion Lab founder and rocket scientist Jack Parsons, who later recruited artist Cameron into Crowley’s occult Thelemic religion. Cameron, who became Parsons’s wife, acted in films by Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger and is witchily powerful in the latter’s 1954–66 short Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome, on view here. When Hay founded the Mattachine Society, the pioneering gay rights group (out of which came ONE Magazine and the ONE Archive, the organizers of this show) in 1950, he based some of their structure on secret societies like the Freemasons, a different kind of fraternal order. Fantasy often provides a cover (literally, for magazines, and figuratively, of course, for homosexuality), as seen in Bob Mizer’s physique pictorials or Margaret Brundage’s spicy, barely crypto-lesbian covers for pulp rag Weird Tales. Off-world landscapes populated by lonesome, hunky men, gossamer boudoir fantasies, ritual satanic symbols, topless muscular butch amazons fighting spindly monsters, and a cast of lusty bedroom heroes are all on display here and deserve their own review. Before summoning Scientology (its own special brew of the esoteric and sci-fi), L. Ron Hubbard was a co-ritualist of Parsons, whom he defrauded at some juncture with some sex-cult messiness. Hubbard also was in the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society with Jim Kepner, a member of the Mattachine Society along with Hay. The above is just a taste of the many confluences detailed within the exhibition through its hot mix of infographics, ephemera, costumes, photography, films, props, artifacts, literature, and art. A mirrored dressing room of vintage face paint and coifed wigs of the Freemasons leads to a painted backdrop, with stairs guiding viewers into a swirling cosmos. Here, arcane symbols for the fraternal order’s secret initiation rites float. The first cosplay costumes ever worn, donned in 1939 by Forrest Ackerman and Myrtle Douglas, have been lovingly re-created. Backlit lesbian peep-show slides beam not far from the lurid colors of witches and amazon wrestlers on covers of the first run of Weird Tales (1922–54). Parsons’s decadent poetry can be read alongside the spidery ink-and-paint illustrations made by Cameron to accompany her husband’s verse, unpublished before the rocket scientist’s mysterious death. (“Narcissus,” his poem on display, reads: “Drug me with drugs / Slow-acting, sensuous, sweet . . . Until I see / Ochre and mazarine and purple / Emit lascivious sounds.”) Fantasy does triple labor here: We see, of course, the fantasy of future play, à la the visions of alternative/cosmic/futurist space as a way out of a dismal present provided by Iain M. Banks, Octavia Butler, and Ursula Le Guin. Fantasy also appears as thinly veiled queer desire, especially when criminal (as it was until fairly recently in the United States). Finally, we get fantasy in terms of the world’s etymological root, meaning “to make visible,” as in the summoning of secret, subtle knowledge of the occult. Los Angeles—the city that built the twentieth century by way of aerospace and Hollywood, New Agery, and culty wellness—was one of the few places where this specific ravel of connections and overlaps was possible, born from its ease in imagining. “Sci-Fi, Magick, Queer L.A.”reveals the ideas, desires, and aesthetics that so easily crossed scenes and media, the low and high, the spiritual and corporal, all in the service of imagining a world better than this one. Its organizers didn’t forget that Edgar Allan Poe’s particular brand of macabre was a gateway drug for the Symbolists and Surrealists, as well as for everyone from H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King to the creators of about half the blockbusters at your local cineplex. Weird tales indeed. The easiest way to change the world involves transposing it via a turn of phrase: setting it upside down by uttering the cheap, portable tools of poetry to summon and lead us to better, imagined worlds. (It isn’t lost on me that Kepner and others here were also Communists.) In fantasy, anything becomes possible.",

         "Following stops at the Frist Art Museum in Nashville, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, “Raqib Shaw: Ballads of East and West” has landed in Los Angeles as the London-based artist’s much-hyped first solo museum exhibition on the West Coast. While the core of the survey curated by Zehra Jumabhoy remained consistent across the tour, Shaw has added two new contributions for the Huntington: a pair of large tapestries installed above the central staircase of the Beaux Arts mansion—once the lavish winter residence of Henry and Arabella Huntington—that now houses the institution’s collection of British and European art. The works inject a rather less untroubled scene than the idyllic landscapes, mannered backdrops for gentry or pastoral fantasies found elsewhere in the building. Like so much of Shaw’s citational art, these new textiles reference historical painting (Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s Tower of Babel, ca. 1563, and John Martin’s Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum, 1822), but also earlier works from Shaw’s series “Space Between Dreams,” 2022–23. Here, Shaw’s visions of erupting flames and melting ice introduce plausible alternatives of the world’s end into the Huntington’s cloistered sanctuaries of gentility. These tapestries suggest a none-too-subtle ecological read (especially when paired, as the exhibition is, with another current show at the Huntington dealing with industrialization and the global economy, “Storm Cloud: Picturing the Origins of Our Climate Crisis”). If also fraught with registrations of vulnerability, the bulk of Shaw’s earlier contributions do not necessarily thematize environmental cause or catastrophe; when they do introduce such motifs, it is often at the margins, as in That Night in Xanadu, 2019–21, in which rabbits holding pocket watches stand sentinel at the painting’s lower corners. On a balcony precipice framed by court architecture, a man wearing a kimono dangles a golden birdcage, releasing green parakeets. Here, Shaw imagines the Mongol ruler’s summer palace and its impossibly luxuriant Himalayan surrounds through his memories of a lost childhood in Kashmir, India. As the Kipling-derived title of the show broadly suggests, Shaw operates in a plaintive key. Autobiographically inflected paintings figure the artist’s surrogates as a joker, a saint, and a Hindu deity, among other forms, and offer reckonings with migratory displacement, political violence, and loss. Even The Departure (After Tintoretto), 2021–22, a painting centered on a gilded staircase atop which a seated dog pulsing with light gazes still upward, commemorates Shaw’s dead terrier. Such manifest content is characteristically belied by visual and material lushness, the product of Shaw’s method of applying enamel paint to wood panels using porcupine quills. Installed in a deep-teal gallery, the encrusted surfaces of the artist’s seven oversize paintings line the walls without much space between. The physical experience is one of satiety, occasioned by the admiration of a single work filled with so many intricate and information-dense areas of competing focus within a circumscribed area. The epic The Retrospective 2002–22, 2015–22, is a showstopper (literally so, as it was impossible to pass around those clustered around it in the narrow room). Modeled on Giovanni Paolo Panini’s virtuosic chockablock Picture Gallery with Views of Modern Rome, 1757, it depicts some sixty of Shaw’s earlier paintings re-created within the picture. So intricate is the composition that a giant label nearby diagrams the dozens of components, becoming a kind of work in itself. Amid the painted inventory, Shaw’s alter-ego appears in the frame dressed in a Venetian carnival mask, standing on a makeshift pedestal (an empty crate emblazoned with the word FRAGILE); he holds forth as a conductor, waving a toilet plunger as a baton. Mountains loom in the distance and, in an acknowledgment of impotence despite mastery, fire closes in.",

         "Jeremy Frey’s meticulously woven objects, which here included baskets as well as wall-based sculptures, reveal a dizzying level of technical fluency. Each one is crafted from the supple bark of the black ash tree (which the artist directly harvests from the land surrounding his studio in Maine) and woven in accordance with Wabanaki basketry techniques, an art form passed down through Frey’s family for generations and one that predates the colonization of New England by millennia. Throughout his exhibition, Frey both celebrated and deconstructed the language of the Wabanaki vessels, employing its signature patterning to create prints and other abstract shapes that disrupted the closed form of the basket, and staking out a more mutable and at times esoteric vocabulary in turn. While process isn’t synonymous with meaning, an understanding of the intricacies of Frey’s laborious technique illuminates readings of his work. Here, each notch and gesture originates with the black ash, a deciduous tree that features prominently in the culture of the Wabanaki (a collection of five Indigenous tribes including the Passamaquoddy, Frey’s ancestral group). According to tribal mythology, when the heroic figure Glooscap shot an arrow into the tree’s woody body, it catalyzed the birth of the Wabanaki people. The tree functions as a conduit for creation in other ways as well. Unlike other North American trees, its growth rings lack the pulpy fibers that typically fuse concentric layers of bark together, and when a fallen trunk is carefully pounded, its bark can be split apart to create highly flexible sheaths that are ideally suited for weaving. This material lineage positions Frey’s objects in unique somatic relation to the Passamaquoddy landscape: A work such as Presence, 2024, for example—a tall lidded basket ringed with protruding scarlet spikes (a signature motif) and thin bands of turquoise—indexes the ecological conditions that nourished its existence, evidenced by the symbolic arboreal growth rings reflected in its weave. Furthermore, its columnar shape, echoed by baskets such as Eden and Specter, both 2024, the latter of which also includes sharp, knifelike protrusions, alludes to a cylindrical trunk, perhaps venerating the tree’s native form. In the exhibition’s titular work, Unbound, 2024—a monumental, wall-based weaving—the skeletal structure of the vessel is flattened and splayed open, revealing the magnanimous architecture of the underlying weave. The object adopts a starburst form: A soft pyramidal mound is orbited by concentric rings of cerulean spikes that radiate outward; they appear tiny in the center and grow exponentially larger at the margins, producing the hypnotic illusion of a rippling portal. The unpainted wooden splints that emerge from the outer edges of the weave suggest that this tondoesque form could expand infinitely, setting up an intriguing dialectical relationship with the closed and completed baskets exhibited nearby. Elsewhere, small sections of flat, framed weavings (e.g., Distraction, 2023) functioned as matrices for a series of relief prints on paper; these works included both linear and circular compositions and were often set against a prismatic ground of chine collé (e.g., Untitled, 2023). Here, errant fibers, ghostly traces of wood grain, the syrupy texture of ink, and the pliant geometries of the woven form—over, under, behind, between, and through—coalesce to form ephemeral tableaus that are both indebted to and independent from their unique cultural origins. Much like the Wabanaki basket and the black ash tree, these immaculate weavings and their printed companions serve as material ciphers for one another, reciprocally reenacting their intertwined histories. In a 2023 video interview, Frey remarked that weaving was “one of the languages my tribe speaks, and I am one of the carriers of that language.” Embodying this analogy, his objects, in addition to being formal sculptural achievements, both contain and transmit important vernacular information. As vessels removed from their traditional functions, Frey’s baskets ultimately serve as receptacles for the intergenerational transference of skilled labor and knowledge, the preservation of which crucially defies colonial dogmas of assimilation and eradication.",

         "To describe Lisa Williamson’s latest exhibition, “Hover Land Lover,” as delightful would almost be missing the point. The seventeen immaculately painted basswood-on-aluminum sculptures tickled on many levels, with luscious hypnotic colors and curves (so shiny! so smooth!). A reverie for the linguistic was exemplified in Williamson’s metonymic (and even anagrammatic) titles, as well as in the artist’s poem “LOS ANGELES, BUENOS AIRES, FRANKFURT,” which was almost hidden in plain sight at the gallery’s front desk. All of these idiosyncratic elements collided and brought a welcome poetic backbone to what could have been misconstrued as purely formal, abstract sculptures. But make no mistake: These objects performed a very contemporary kind of gesture, speaking directly to one of art’s most fetishistic forms while simultaneously laughing in its slick, seductive face. While narrative never emerged from the reading of the objects of “Hover Land Lover,” the shapes and surfaces expressed a kind of sensuality and even femininity that played hard against the male-dominated, muscular world of Minimalist sculpture, a distant cousin of these unadorned works. In the front gallery, awash in natural light coming from a huge, frosted, west-facing window, was a grouping of three sculptures respectively titled Comber, Pool, and Plateaus (all works 2024), each hung on their own wall. Pool managed to look both industrial and vaginal: a Titian-blue, oval-shaped deep groove ringed with pink that seemed to emanate its own light. Plateaus indeed carried the topography of an elevated land mass, as indicated by its title, but, paired with the suggestive quality of the other works, could have inferred the more erotic and esoteric “orgasmic plateaus.” To that end, Plateaus also looked like a hunk of chocolate you’d want to take a bite from —bronze, yummy, and toothsome. Comber, a long, thin, shiny, elliptical silver object resembling a gigantic needle, also hinted at central core imagery. Each of these sculptures contributed its own charismatic strangeness to the presentation. Their smooth surfaces and gleaming finishes conjured a surreal, ecstatic feeling, as if anyone present was about to be abducted by aliens or to undergo some groundbreaking surgical procedure. The largest gallery contained eight wall-hung paint-and-lacquer-on-basswood sculptures, evenly spaced and resembling the dots and dashes of Morse code. The four “dots” were each identical in scale (close to the size of A4 letter paper), while the four “dashes” were similar in thickness and height but varied in length. Speaker, Chimera, and Fields shared one wall, and each artwork again performed, somehow, as its respective title. Speaker was rendered as a white box containing black drivers, and with an expertly crafted finish that seemed like a nerdy rendition of trompe l’oeil. Chimera borrowed from the hues of a classic Color Field painting: half maroon, half black, zipped down the middle with a strip of contrasting neon pink. Fields portrayed three equally sized neon-green rectangles approximating grass, in a Peter Halley–esque nod to neo-Conceptualism. The rest of the sculptures in this configuration operated on a similarly high, playful key that verged on sardonic—New Wave, for example, was a blue wooden wave. And while, like Minimalism, each work of art was not a means of self-expression, the whole formed, quite literally, a language, with each artwork a synecdoche for an unknown, unexplored whole. The artist’s poem, copies of which were printed on thick ecru paper and neatly stacked between the press release and guest book, was presented as part of the gallery material. Part prosody, part word list, part nonsense, it was revelatory and kind. A sheer scaffold of subject, with no pretense, it offered up language as art’s equally mysterious and mischievous partner. With this counterpoint in mind, what separates Williamson’s referential sculptures (to dwell on their dialogue with Light and Space or Finish Fetish is too dull, too obvious) is that they are a tour de force of semiotic power—color, shape, material, word, configuration, sign, symbol, message. The repetition of almost banal materials and scales, each treated with such impeccable tenderness and artistry, is a gut punch to any cult leader of originality, or even subjectivity: There is nothing new under the sun. And yet, art prevails, as long as we remain open to its revisions and repetitions—in order to find something worth finding in its ineffable wordless surfaces.",

         "“Creoleness” argued the Martinican writers Jean Bernabé, Patrick Chamoiseau, and Raphaël Confiant, “is . . . not just expressing a crossing or any other unicity. It is expressing a kaleidoscopic totality.” Painter Firelei Báez’s first midcareer survey, which opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, last year and is now at the Vancouver Art Gallery—offers portals into this kaleidoscopic totality. The artist’s colorful, ambitious tableaux present a nonreductive flowing together of historical and cultural elements to reclaim the space of identity. Five dazzlingly hued canvases, in which Báez both shields and elevates her subjects, are installed across the gallery’s main rotunda at the heart of the show. The first one we encounter is Madeleine (Rupture rapture maroonage), 2022. The work is based on Marie-Guillemine Benoist’s Portrait of Madeline, 1800, a Neoclassical painting of a young Black woman in the collection of the Louvre in Paris (a symbol of emancipation, the work was also famously featured in Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s 2018 music video for “Apeshit”). Yet in Báez’s arch-shaped picture, the figure is barely perceptible, as she has been transformed into a blaze of swirling light. Only her headdress, rendered in an indigo-patterned print, can be made out. During a public conversation with the artist, the show’s curator, Eva Respini, said that Báez engages squarely with the traditions of “capital P” painting. The artist melds experiences from her own life and Afro-Caribbean heritage with references to the Black Power movement, tropical flora, colonialism, and speculative fiction. By combining the old with the new, she critiques history but does not erase it. Báez holistically reflects on issues impacting the present with the hope of creating tools for addressing them in the future. Bernabé, Chamoiseau, and Confiant were part of a group of writers, along with Édouard Glissant, who considered the Caribbean a site in which the “real forges of a new humanity, where languages, races, religions, customs, ways of being from all over the world were brutally uprooted and transplanted in an environment where they had to reinvent life.” Báez vigorously reshapes aspects of subjectivity, identity, and belief systems as a way to counter this violence. She calls her works “propositions,” in which all her figures and forms exist in a continual state of opacity (à la Glissant) and becoming. Báez’s cast of characters include the ciguapa, an enigmatic femme from Dominican and Haitian folklore who has flowing hair and backward-facing feet. She also includes tentacular humanoids, inspired by the Oankali from Octavia Butler’s sci-fi trilogy Lilith’s Brood (1987–89). The artist’s subjects are frequently depicted as single (and singularly confident) figures within her compositions, often surrounded by charts and maps. For example, in Untitled (Terra Nova),2020, a ciguapa crouches in front of one of the first renderings of the New World from 1541. The artist’s multidimensional “tignon” paintings reflect on the segregation laws introduced in 1786 during Spanish colonial rule, when freed Creole women of African descent had to wear headscarves, in the same way that slaves were made to. By depicting her women adorned in colorful tignons with complex pattens and jewels, Báez allows her subjects to regain their dignity and autonomy. The giant headdress worn by the sitter in Sans-Souci (This threshold between a dematerialized and a historicized body), 2015, appears to be embodied, as if it were an extension of the subject herself, who looks serenely and unabashedly back at us. This presentation’s showstopping finale, A Drexcyen chronocommons (To win the war you fought it sideways), 2019, is a multimedia installation that references, among other topics, the mythical Drexciyan civilization (born out of the abysmal Middle Passage) and the first Queen of Haiti, Marie-Louise Coidavid, and her daughters. The work features a series of blue tarpaulins (often used to provide temporary shelter after hurricanes) that have been elaborately cut out—when light shines through them, a dappled effect is created. The piece provides a space for remembrance and healing. It is breathtaking and affecting, bringing joy and succor to a building that was once a courthouse. Báez’s art, beyond its elusiveness and dazzle, offers a space of freedom.",

         "For the recurring exhibition Panorama da Arte Brasileira, launched in 1969, the Museu de Arte Moderna de São Paulo (MAM) invites curators to present their perspectives on the current state of Brazilian art. Often these shows have been lackluster affairs, rather conventional in outlook, typically neglecting anything truly dissonant or dissident. But for this year’s thirty-eighth program, curators Germano Dushá, Thiago de Paula Souza, and Ariana Nuala disrupted that tendency, proposing a hopeful and high-intensity aesthetic reflecting the country’s inflamed cultural hybridisms. As indicated by the title, “Mil Graus” (A Thousand Degrees), extreme heat was the guide for gathering and critique. Such heat is presumably strong enough to dissolve any possible material, preconceived epistemology, environmental stability, or spiritual order. Our present already smolders in extreme conditions: Frederico Filippi’s Moquém – Carnes de caça (Moquém – Game Meats), 2023–24—a scatter installation composed of strip-mining machinery with tractor parts burned in illegal mines in the Brazilian Amazon—presents a faithful portrait of the ecopolitical catastrophe that is already ongoing. Due to renovation in the MAM building, “Mil Graus” was held at the premises of Museu de Arte Contemporânea, just across the street. In the entrance mezzanine, Adriano Amaral’s impactful installation Cabeça D’Água (Flash Flood), 2024, welcomed visitors into an octagonal chamber with cyborg-like objects made of silicone, burned soccer cleats, and goose feet hanging on the walls. Meanwhile, in a central baptismal font, viscous fluid stirred by a pneumatic motor affixed to the ceiling repeatedly submerged and uncovered several skulls—the effect suggesting an anabolized, mystical update of Bruce Nauman’s 3 Heads Fountain (3 Andrews), 2005. “Mil Graus” presented arts of the sort that have rarely been exhibited in any previous edition of Panorama or the São Paulo Bienal, including works made by members of carnival troupes, practitioners of Indigenous and Afro-diasporic religions, and artists whose work has been sidelined as naive or folkloric. Also present were institutionally celebrated names, among them Solange Pessoa, who presented soapstone sculptures with encrusted spirals on the museum’s external loggia, and Lucas Arruda, with vaporous oil paintings in a small, silent Albertian chapel built specifically for the show. Reflecting what anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro calls “cannibal metaphysics,” a group of works by Rop Cateh, a collective of Indigenous Akroá-Gamella people, foregrounded expressions of Amerindian perspectivism. In their photo collage Rop, 2024, a jaguar’s head is intercut with part of a man’s, including his eyes, and the head is surrounded by the silhouette of a feather headdress. Mineral/animal transfiguration is also embodied in Maria Lira Marques’s symbolic paintings using earthy natural pigments on stones from the central region of Brazil. For Animais e Ornamentos (Animals and Ornaments), 2024—sculptures of metamorphic animals such as birds, horses, and alligators—Marina Woisky took illustrations from books on natural history, applied arts, and tapestry and printed them on sewn fabrics filled with concrete, as if artificially fossilized. The heat of the streets is the context for Gabriel Massan’s Baile do Terror (Dance of Terror), 2022–24, an immersive installation of a digital universe that denounces Brazilian police violence at funk dances. MEXA, a group that critically fights for LGBTQI+ rights, also zeroed in on celebratory resistance amid atrocious violence: At the show’s opening, they staged A última ceia (abertura) (The Last Supper [Opening]), a participatory performance involving the group’s dozen members and the audience at a long table set with food and drinks in a parodic re-creation of Leonardo’s famous mural. If one thinks back to the previous edition of Panorama, “Sob as cinzas, brasa” (Under the ashes, embers) in 2022—which also touched on tropes of burning and heat in critiquing colonial history and Brazilian modernism—it becomes clear that what counts in an exhibition of this nature is not its theme but its curatorial construction. Whereas the “ashes” of the 2022 Panorama radiated—weakly—a residual languid heat, “Mil Graus” blared with agonizing and transcendental sounds of bodies hissing in absolute fervor.",

         "In 1985, Brazil emerged from twenty-one years of military dictatorship, with its population experiencing a feeling of release and enthusiasm that was not without its own challenges. “Fullgás—Artes Visuais e Anos 1980 no Brasil” (Fullgás—Visual Arts and the 1980s in Brazil), organized by Raphael Fonseca, focused on its subject with a depth rarely seen before. The exhibition, whose title is taken from that of a 1984 song by pop singer Marina Lima and plays on the Portuguese word fugaz (fleeting), placed artists from all regions of the country in dialogue with memorabilia from the era, portraying a nation longing to reestablish democratic governance amid inflation, epidemics, and rising demands for historically neglected rights. One of the focal points of the show was the occupation of public space through performative actions. Ricardo Basbaum’s Olho (Eye), 1987, for instance, is a sticker with an image of an eye. He affixed this mass-produced icon, similar in design to a business logo, to surfaces all around Rio and other cities; the omnipresent eye recalled surveillance under the dictatorship—by that time over, but the trauma it caused persisted. Even as the country longed for liberty, the long shadows of vigilance and punishment remained. The show also highlighted the freedom of expression enjoyed by artists in this period. After two decades of institutionalized censorship, Brazilian artists were finally able to represent their nonnormative sexualities—for example, in Rosa Gauitano’s Boate Dinosaurus (Dinosaur Nightclub), 1978–79, a photograph of two women kissing in a nightclub, or in Hudinilson Jr.’s wallpaper piece Posição amorosa (Amorous Position), 1983, an immense grid of images showing a woman, faceless and with bare breasts, from different angles. In 1978, Brazil, still under dictatorship, saw the establishment of its first magazine for the gay community, and, in the 1980s, the country witnessed a rise in collective organizing for the civil rights of Black communities (portrayed by photographer Mobi in the city of São Luís). With an increasing interest in the visual cultures of Indigenous peoples, some artists—among them Elieser Rufino—began to focus on local cultures and traditions. Although the country was still quite conservative, people were creating networks for discourse about democratic imperatives. That process would reach its apex in 1988 with the promulgation of a new constitution. The artistic community’s contribution to this larger public discussion about democratic rights was important. Yet the shadow of violence legitimated by the dictatorship still lingered over Brazilian art. Gervane de Paula’s Donato bola de polícia (Assailed Police Head), 1982, and Maurício Castro’s Dr. Tibiriçá, 1987—titled with the code name for dictatorship-era military officer Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra—exhibit, in the most literal ways, the barbarity of the military personnel and the cruel persecution of those who opposed the regime. The sign of an inner malady is also present in the early paintings of Adriana Varejão. In one of them, Dilúvio (Flood), 1985, dense oil paint forms dark zones of an abstract composition that addresses, perhaps, a sense of national uncertainty. The AIDS epidemic put the brakes on much of Brazil’s newfound euphoria. Works like those of Leonilson, who died as a result of the virus, express loneliness and the sting of prejudice alongside metaphors of love and a desire for life. Humor, too, was a tool. Barrão’s sculpture 10 centavos assalta 1 cruzado (10 Cents Robs 1 Cruzado), 1987, alludes ironically to the different economic plans and currencies that Brazil adopted throughout the decade as a means of containing inflation. Society, however fragile, was still capable of laughing at itself. Translated from Portuguese by Liam Seeley.",

         "Sammy Baloji’s recent exhibition broadly addressed Congolese nationhood and American and European expansionism from the nineteenth century onward. The show continued the artist’s long-term exploration of “extraction” as interpreted through photographs, botanical samples, audio and video recordings, and archival literature sparsely laid out in vitrines. These items included stamped workers’ documents from a Congolese mining district; propagandist flyers on uranium production; and, incredibly, an itinerary for the “first uranium world tour” of mining sites in Australia, South Africa, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo that ends with sightseeing in Cairo, Rome, Paris, and London. The archives Baloji researched for the works in this show include those of the Royal Prussian Phonographic Commission, now in the Sound Archive of the Humboldt-Universität in Berlin, and the Institut National des Etudes et Recherches Agronomiques (INERA) in Kinshasa, Congo, as well as Brussels’ Center for the Archives of Communism in Belgium. The exhibition included four works that have been previously exhibited in international exhibitions and two new commissions. Still Kongo I–V, 2024, is a set of five monochrome aerial images of the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve (said to be the second largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon), framed with heavyset wood in a design inspired by Belgian Art Nouveau. Triga Mark III, 2024, is an extension of an earlier work, Shinkolobwe’s abstraction, 2022, first commissioned for the Sharjah Biennial 2022 and consists of fifteen screen prints that are composed of red and yellow color patterns abstracted from Congolese uranium samples and layered over photographs of atomic clouds. Both works are the product of an ongoing dialogue between Baloji and Pedro Monaville, a Canada-based Belgian historian and author of the study Students of the World: Global 1968 and Decolonization in the Congo (2022). A text by Monaville is offered as a handout to visitors, as if to press home any historical consequences not apparent elsewhere in the exhibition. Titled “Abstraction and a Capricious Sinuosity” (2024), the text is largely an intellectual buttress for Baloji’s interests in the Congolese archive of the Cold War. Monaville’s stated aim, in relation to Shinkolobwe’s abstraction, is to “reclaim abstraction as a strategy of historical illumination.” But the problem is that, when displayed alongside a wealth of archival literature, Shinkolobwe’s abstraction takes the form of a commemorative work in service of the research that birthed it, rather than an autonomous source of illumination. Furthermore, the work recalls what Okwui Enwezor described, in his 2008 essay “Archive Fever,” as the “excess of the seen,” thanks to an overfamiliarity with the work’s real-world sources (in this case American abstraction and images of the atomic clouds in Japan) that limits our engagement with it. Among the previously exhibited works on view here was Aequare. The Future That Never Was, 2023, a collage of archival and recent documentary footage about the research activities at Yangambi, which was the largest of more than thirty experimental complexes created by what was then the National Institute for the Agronomic Study, Belgian Congo—the predecessor to INERA—in 1933. In one sequence, staffers are shown consulting a physical archive as we watch them through archival film. A telegraphic power emanates even within reels of staged laboratory experiments, labor, and everyday social life that falsely present Belgian imperialism as progressive on scientific advancement and inclusive on matters of race and power balance. Baloji’s sensitive handling of the footage lays bare the artifice of filmmaking and its use as a manipulative tool. Although, as Shinkolobwe’s abstraction suggests, Baloji’s method has its limits, this survey demonstrated that his career-long engagement with some of the most important issues of our time—from nuclear power to climate change, from environmentalism to the epistemological violence of colonialism—has much to offer.",

         "As I stood on Shoreditch High Street, spying through narrow pipe jutting from a window, I felt like a peeping Tom. But really, although I was peeking in at a naked lady, she was part of a collage by Düsseldorf-based Slovakian artist Stanislava Kovalčíková for her recent exhibition “ret rie vers” at Emalin’s second exhibition space, the Clerk’s House. The piece also included giant snail shells, a sunrise, a vulva badge, and two images of the late Queen Elizabeth II, one on a postage stamp, the other clipped from a British banknote. It was like a hornier version of a Joseph Cornell box, but with the vibe of Marcel Duchamp’s Étant donnés (1946–66). Inside, Kovalčíková’s exhibition filled every nook and cranny of the Clerk’s House. The artist had turned the space into something like a Prussian fun house: mirrored rooms, mannequins, and huge antique clockfaces—stripped of their hands, these had now been repurposed as surfaces for paintings. Wolkenkratzer (Skyscraper), 2024, shows, among other things, a woman hanging by her bound wrists, an image familiar from so many horror films. A huge clump of gray wool (real, not painted) pours out of the victim’s mouth, as if she were spewing up an old lady’s wig. Other characters in the composition seem casually complicit in her suffering: A finger points, either in judgment or in perverse delight, while another girl stares down in casual contempt, arms crossed, cigarette dangling from her lips. This and other clock paintings on view felt like illustrations for stories not yet written, although Kovalčíková has said that “faces and bodies are more substantial than the storyline of the painting.” Meanwhile, the house itself had been carpeted with a rigid patchwork of orange, black, and mustard hues familiar to any weary passenger of the London Underground. The District Line moquette was designed in the 1970s by Jacqueline Groag, a Czech Jewish textile designer. Here, this pattern seemed retro yet chic: a tasteful interior choice, symbolic of a time when one could imagine a cleaner, faster future. Yet when you find yourself stuck in one of the city’s more dated subway trains, your seat stained with grime and spilled takeout, this fabric stands for drudgery, bad food, and journeys delayed by signal failure—a perfect example of the mix of “Modernism and contemporary decay” mentioned in the press release. The final clock painting, Clerk‘s Medusa, 2024,was up in the attic, propped against the wall on a mirrored floor. The piece depicted only half of the Gorgon’s face, but the other half was supplied by the reflection in the floor—reminding us of the mirror Perseus used in order to kill her without looking directly at her. Historically, this room would have been the servants’ quarters, and I loved that the space was off-limits to visitors: I had to crane my neck around the door to get a glimpse, making sure I didn’t tumble down the narrow staircase behind me. Throughout history, the image of the Medusa has been used as an apotropaic, displayed on door knockers, shields, and crockery to ward off evil. Kovalčíková flipped this tradition, squirreling the old Gorgon up in the attic and almost out of sight. Sigmund Freud thought the Medusa myth was all about the fear of castration—of course he did. Another sculpture downstairs, Follow the Boys (Shoe), 2023, contained similar Freudian themes. A stiletto-clad foot juts out from the wall, the shoe’s heel consisting of a severed penis shaft and grisly pair of golden testicles: part feminist trophy, part disaster at the s/m club. The exhibition text mentioned “our nervous attachment to time”; clocks and cocks may be equally unserviceable. It seemed that, in this show, time is most neurotic when it stops moving forward.",

         "Seeing Emma Rose Schwartz’s London debut, “Old Mortality,” felt like getting sudden flashes of someone else’s childhood memories. Her paintings’ elegantly distressed surfaces offer glimpses of implied narratives featuring female protagonists—several of whom stare intensely outward. The figures’ anatomies feel reimagined rather than observed, with body parts folding or fading into one another. Crudely drawn buildings and other architectural fragments suggest locations whose significance would be legible only to their author and presumably the characters within the work. As viewers, we are left to weigh these diffuse details against the concentration of affect found in the faces with finely drawn features that punctuate these scenes. Schwartz’s palette consists of ruddy bursts of sienna and other earth tones amid large swaths of beige and gray. One of two tall canvases hanging next to each other, Certain Planet (all works 2024) depicts two figures with reddish hair in a curious configuration: A girl, loosely drawn, lies on the ground holding a rodent between her hands while above her hovers a woman with long flowing hair and a pair of opaque white legs. Irregular chunks of pink paint hover amid gaps in what could be her torso, whose chunky solidity grounds what is otherwise an airy composition. These works are strongest when looser passages of opaque paint pull against the graphic economy of the faces. The figures in Fortunate Relative appear atop some pale blue foliage with hazy pink blobs denoting flowers. The suggested scenery sweetens an anatomically confused depiction of what looks like a mother holding her daughter, but these blooms and leaves are also compelling simply as colorful shapes. Schwartz’s chromatic restraint and rugged drawing distinguish her from the legion of young painters using a stylized figuration à la Kai Althoff to make enchanted scenes that evoke a bygone era, and often indulge in a chromatic opulence and decorative flourishes. Schwartz’s pictures feel more connected to farmhouses than cosmopolitan decadence. Although the resulting images look quite different, her practice of adhering thin paper to her canvases and painting on top of the crinkled surface recalls the work of Samuel Hindolo, another contemporary painter who cultivates patina and visible wear. Middle Creek has large areas whose primary attraction is the rhythmic energy of Schwartz’s hand scratching into wet paint with a tool, while a large black cloud hovers above. This passage holds together much better than the passage in TV Sunrise, where the texture of crinkled paper becomes monotonous as it fills out the shape of a couch outlined in charcoal, which occupies most of the large canvas. In the gallery office hung two paintings whose saturation and density seemed to break with the rest of the show. Warm light bathes the face of a seated figure in Out Front—an ominous image with the spooky intensity of a séance. In it, Schwartz abandons her tendency to leave raw canvas between the facial features and successfully merges scratchy lines that articulate, for instance, an eyelid with splotchy shading that describes the curvature of a cheek. The sense of mass makes this figure feel like much more than a mere symbol, amplifying the impact of this work considerably. Schwartz’s visual language is imbued with a sense of the past. She immerses us in the fragmentary logic of visual memory, with details whose significance is implied but never explained. The evocation of nineteenth-century painting creates an immediate familiarity that grants viewers smooth entry despite the works’ enigmas, but at the cost of diminishing the friction that opens new aesthetic territory. The paintings’ strength turns out to be inseparable from their limitations.",

         "A sense of uneasy stasis charged the atmosphere at Katie Watchorn’s exhibition “dry brimmings.” Sternly Minimalist in style and composed of a spartan array of prosaic utilitarian objects, Watchorn’s installation resembled the comfortless storeroom of a shuttered shop: a onetime place of business apparently abandoned. Clustered on the floor were five little headless busts and miniature plinths of the sort used to display necklaces in jewelry stores, their suede and velour coverings hinting at vanished shopwindow glamour. Attached to the walls were light fixtures, heating-control units, and vertical blinds. Each manufactured component, however mundane, made a nuanced impression. A pair of wall-mounted lights, glowing weakly above the petite, floor-standing display busts, paired an indoor fluorescent lamp with an outdoor, weatherproof LED: contrasting types of illumination, mismatched as if they were makeshifts. Two bulky air curtains took turns issuing sequenced bursts of mechanical wind—the designed purpose of these appliances being to form an immaterial division at the entrance to a building, separating inside and outside with a temperature-regulating barrier. Here, however, the programmed gusts (as with the twinned lights) seemed no longer dependent on any such binary separation of interior and exterior space. On one of the units, Watchorn placed four thermal travel mugs, signaling prior human presence, while implicitly linking the heat-maintaining capacity of the metallic cups with the environmental function of the industrial air curtains. Nearby, a set of tall window blinds wafted in the intermittent breeze. As with other elements of the installation, this addition was both unremarkable—a standard domestic or office accessory—and oddly ill-fitting. The blinds lined a wall rather than a window. The hanging louvers draped onto the floor, a size too big for their setting. Most strangely, a sleek panel with curved edges jutted through the vertical slats—a partition without any evident purpose, both in the way and out of place. Pronounced banality, then, plus mystery: Watchorn’s exhibition appeared to call for careful detective work. But if the show prompted narrative speculation—on the who, what, and why of this enigmatic scenario—it also held sleuthing or storytelling in suspension. The full collective title applied to these arrayed objects was Dry brimming thresholds (commutes between fantasies), 2024: a string of incongruent terms that underlined the installation’s inside/outside simultaneity and affirmed Watchorn’s continuing interest in the materiality, the psychology, and perhaps the politics of in-between states. Until now, her sculptures have principally drawn inspiration from the converging forces shaping present-day life in rural Ireland. Watchorn comes from a County Clare farming background: a context that she represents, and radically abstracts, as a site of confluence between human and nonhuman, natural and technological, age-old and ultramodern. Previous sculptural materials have included cast beef fat, welded steel mesh, surfacing aggregate, dehydrated sugar beets, and polished aluminum—adapted products of farm labor that speak of the necessary innovations and strange intersections of contemporary agricultural experience. “dry brimmings” showed the expansion of her art’s sculptural and conceptual scope (augmenting her ecologically connective aesthetic with the use of ready-made items we might associate with commercial, corporate, and other non-farmland contexts), yet also deepened the abiding impression of being caught between colliding worlds. Notably, another curious piece in the overall puzzle was a single-screen video showing a looped, 1 minute 15 second clip of a back massage: intimate skin-on-skin contact, shot close-up in high definition, yet displayed in hazy low-res style on an outmoded dot-structure monitor. Encountered just inside the gallery door—precisely at a threshold point—the footage was visible when arriving and leaving: each time introducing, or reintroducing, imagery with no overt connection to the sculptural compositions in the main gallery. The indistinct video was, even so, an apt beginning and ending: evoking the heat of interacting bodies, highlighting the technological mediation of sensory experience, adding new layers to the overlapping realities of Watchorn’s art—while bringing us, at the point of departure, right back to where we started.",

         "Barnett Newman’s 1946 painting Pagan Void stares you down at the start of “L’Âge atomique: Les artistes à l’épreuve de l’histoire” (The Atomic Age: Artists Put to the Test of History), a visual tour of modernity as seen through the lens of nuclear technology. Newman’s work features a rough black circle that looks like a bloodshot eye or, on second glance, a fertilized egg. Or maybe it’s a scaled-up atomic nucleus. It’s impossible to pin down any singular meaning or interpretation; just when you think you’ve solved its riddle, the shape shifts again. Pagan Void was painted the same year the United States Navy conducted widely photographed tests of nuclear weapons at Bikini Atoll and a year after the US unleashed two atomic bombs over Japan. Newman’s painting is just one of many significant artworks that respond to these pivotal moments. Curators Julia Garimorth and Maria Stavrinaki have divided the sweeping show into three parts: “The Disintegration of Matter,” “The Bomb,” and “The Nuclearization of the World.” The first section—installed in a gallery with high ceilings and white walls—is a light overture to the coming darkness. We begin the journey toward nuclearization in the 1890s, when, as the wall text notes, scientists demonstrated that the atom was not as stable as originally thought, and that matter is penetrable by invisible rays and radioactivity. The material on Loïe Fuller’s 1904 Radium Dance is particularly compelling. In 1911 Fuller performed the work at her Paris studio with physicists Marie and Pierre Curie in the audience. After dancing, the choreographer delivered a philosophical lecture on radium. Her notebook for the lecture is displayed in the exhibition, resting open on the first page, thoughts scratched out and rephrased, as unstable and changeable as the element itself. Fuller’s notes are exhibited alongside manuscripts and hand-drawn diagrams by the Curies, Niels Bohr, and Henri Becquerel. These scientific visuals enter into conversation with the artworks displayed across the gallery: paintings and drawings by Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint, and Mikhail Larionov illustrating early experiments in abstraction; a diorama by Marcel Duchamp; and so on. Artists give shape and voice to the modern passion for discovery, as they will in the show’s later chapters on the universal urgency and angst of the nuclear age. “The Bomb” section begins in a smaller, more darkly lit space, where one encounters the first of several series of videos of atomic tests, as well as photographs and ephemera from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Each piece is neatly pinned to a black wall with thumbtacks, giving the impression of a war room. Among these are a typewritten letter from Albert Einstein to Franklin D. Roosevelt and a shadowy photograph of J. Robert Oppenheimer in profile—men whose presence looms in the margins of the exhibition. Perhaps the most moving items here are drawings by survivors of the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Setsuko Yamamoto, just fourteen at the time of the bombing, drew herself stepping over bodies to get out of a tram. In simple words, she captions the image: “Just after the atomic explosion, I stepped on the injured to get out.” An ambient, war-zone soundscape, meanwhile, has been emanating from a device playing Yoko Ono’s 1995 “Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue”—a chorus with visceral moans and cries of pain. A series of photographs of the atomic mushroom cloud from midcentury American periodicals and propaganda serves as a coda for the “Bomb” section and an entry into “Nuclearization.” Among them is an image by Don English for the Las Vegas News Bureau, showing ballet dancer Sally McCloskey posing en pointe in front of a mushroom cloud on Mount Charleston, Nevada—an unnerving callback to Fuller’s Radium Dance. The show’s finale then focuses on the social and political consequences of nuclearization—environmental, feminist, and anti-colonial activism. One particularly striking piece is Tetsumi Kudo’s Grafted Garden/Pollution-Cultivation-New Ecology, 1970–71, a plot of wilting flowers strewn with disembodied limbs, hair, and everyday objects. With its three-act structure, “The Atomic Age” is nothing short of operatic—a reminder that the creative and destructive powers of humans have become entwined with those of the atom.",

         "Chris Ofili presented the ten oil paintings composing “Joyful Sorrow,” his first solo show in Paris, behind individual black-on-black screen-printed curtains. Confronted with these mysterious veils and equipped with black gloves provided at the gallery’s front desk, viewers saw the show by lifting one shroud at a time—performing an intimate act that stimulated the senses and the subconscious all at once. Ofili has long been interested in prolonging or complicating the viewer’s experience, and, in this case, the exercise began even before the first veil was lifted. On each silk cloth, a ghostly apparition—a photographic self-portrait, eyes closed—slowly revealed itself, flickering into view only at close proximity and from certain angles. The works’ black frames, made of charred wood, were carved with elongated bas-relief figures—also intelligible only from up close—as well as the words VENICE and OFILI in looping script. Like mini prosceniums, the dark frames and curtains set the stage for Ofili’s response to Shakespeare’s Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice. Ofili’s engagement with Oth­ello dates back to 2019, when he produced linear white-on-black etchings to illustrate an edition of the play published by David Zwirner Books. In stark contrast with these prints, the paintings in “Joyful Sorrow,” all titled Othello – Shroud and made between 2019 and 2024, were jewel-toned, mottled, and glistening. In each composition, a multicolored masklike face floats in the center above smaller acrobatically posed figures and loose-script handwriting spelling out OTHELLO. The faces are all similar in size, scaled to match what the viewer would expect to see if there was a mirror behind each curtain instead of a painting. Each carnivalesque reflection is adorned with dabs and strokes of iridescent paints that suggest bindis, crowns, horns, collars, and other ornamental accoutrements. Some of these details, such as the massive curling horns, seemed explicit references to Othello. Horns often appear in Ofili’s work as evocations of Jab Jab, or Blue Devil, a figure from the carnival tradition of Trinidad (the artist’s home since 2005). Here, however, the appendages (which sometimes looked very much like a foolscap), recall Iago’s unhumorous description of Othello as an “old black ram,” a slur that refers to the character’s race as well as his presumed cuckoldry, often symbolized by horns. In several paintings, greenish eyes allude to the monstrous role of jealousy in Othello, as do the curtains, which could be read as a reference to Desdemona’s ill-placed handkerchief. More than its plot, the paintings addressed the racial politics of Shakespeare’s text and its many adaptations for stage and film. If the black curtains and charred frames relate to Othello’s dark skin (described in the play as “sooty”), they also evoke the blackface white actors have worn to portray him. In the introduction to the edition of Othello that features Ofili’s illustrations, poet Fred Moten writes, “Othello is an experiment in black personhood for which black persons are not responsible. . . . How does Ofili now refuse it?” In this context, “Joyful Sorrow” refuses Othello by using color, light, and depth to describe complex identities and hidden truths beneath each black surface. The theatrical hide-and-seek staging of “Joyful Sorrow” recalled certain of the artist’s previous presentations—for instance, the chain-link fence in his 2017 New York exhibition “Paradise Lost,” which impeded viewers from fully seeing the paintings installed inside. In Paris, seven years later, similar themes of interiority versus exteriority felt just as acute and even more personal. The private experience of lifting a veil and focusing on one painting at a time was an opportunity to ruminate on hybrid identities and personae. A close and prolonged look at these paintings reveals that they were built up over long periods during which the artist layered many washes of thinned paint. The surfaces have a sheen that, like a varnish, suggests finality, but beneath this, blurred and bleeding colors and forms convey a whole saga of overlay and evolution. Often, faces are split in half, with features that don’t match, suggesting a process: a whole coalescing from multiple contrasting parts. Pushing past Othello’s experience as the other, Ofili made way for a gratifying appreciation of self and selves.",

         "When Mercedes Azpilicueta’s exhibition “Las Mesas Danzantes” (Dancing Tables) opened to the Cordovan public, those of us present witnessed a performance that transformed the ritualized ceremony of the art gallery opening (the air-kisses, the speeches, the beer) into something that evoked another type of ceremony, now nearly forgotten but very fashionable in the nineteenth century: the séance. In collaboration with the artist, two members of Baiven, a young local dance collective, performed a dance in which the two protagonists of the séance—the visible one (the medium) and the invisible one (the spirit)—moved in tandem, pursued or eluded each other, spoke through hand gestures and their bodies, in an atmosphere of comfortable semidarkness and before a silent circle of attendees. The performance was titled Oh, Amalia! in homage to Amalia Domingo Soler, an Andalusian spiritualist born in nearby Seville in 1835. Similar to international divas of spiritualism such as Mina Crandon in the United States or Mary Ann Marshall in Canada, Domingo Soler promoted the spiritualist movement in the Spanish-speaking world. As Jennifer Higgie describes in her fascinating feminist rereading of spiritualism, The Other Side: A Journey into Women, Art and the Spirit World (2023), the movement championed the emancipation of women within freethinking and egalitarian societies. Curators Verónica Rossi and Jimena Blázquez Abascal were right to propose this figure to Azpilicueta as the starting point for a new work because she has long engaged in the historical and artistic rereading of powerful female and gender-nonconforming figures of the past. Her previous subjects include Artemisia Gentileschi, a seventeenth-century painter; Lea Lublin, a feminist Argentinean artist based in Paris in the 1960s; and Catalina de Erauso, also known as Antonio de Erauso and nicknamed La Monja Alférez, the Lieutenant Nun, anambivalent and fascinating figure in early colonial Latin American history who Paul B. Preciado claims is among the first historically documented transgender people. As in previous shows, Azpilicueta used dance and performance during the opening to activate a group of pieces: traditional sculptures that evoke the symbolic leitmotifs of spiritualism (old kerosene lamps, a table that seems to float in the air and to support a disembodied plaster hand); poetic objects created by juxtaposition à la Lautréamont (a Cordovan hat or a Spanish guitar attached to elongated umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, a woman’s boot sprouting green wheat ears); drawings that recall Surrealist automatism and the continuous line so characteristic of Federico García Lorca’s own surrealistic drawings (he was, like Domingo Soler, an Andalusian); and a captivating and bright-colored tapestry of collaged imagery, somewhere between the impassively informational and stubbornly artisanal. Azpilicueta likes to define herself—half jokingly, half sincerely—as a “dishonest researcher,” and in this show she succeeded once again, through her personal visual mix of lyricism and rigor, in recovering a historical figure and a half-forgotten episode of history, shedding new light on them without completely dispelling the delicate penumbra of mystery that gives them their emotional power.

         "Visitors found the entrance to Jacopo Benassi’s exhibition “Sàlvati Salvàti” (Save Yourself Saved) partially blocked by a sort of barricade made up of works from the artist’s archive, concrete blocks, sandbags, a helmet, plaster casts of hands throwing stones, a foot, a pair of slippers, and two flags bearing images of a lobster’s leg and a crab’s claw. Beyond the barricade, visitors entered the actual space, occupied by a small platform or stage, two cameras, speakers, drums, guitars, a flügelhorn, and other musical instruments, some dangling from the ceiling, waiting to be used during the artist’s performances. On the walls, illuminated by spotlights, were photographs and paintings. These featured collage-like superimpositions of other works, the various components held together by straps, spacers, and often rough wooden frames. The overall effect was a chaotic visceral magma that resonates with the punk and underground culture of the 1980s and ’90s, of which the artist was an active participant. The photographs possess a few common traits: They are shot predominantly at night and in black and white, they are technically amateurish, and they are vividly detailed, crass and obscene as a crime-scene photo. Yet they are discreet, never vulgar—at times erotic, at times heroic, often ironic. Unlike his previous work, in which the artist proclaimed his queer identity above all through self-portraiture as well as depictions of people in his circle, these pieces take a more symbolic approach. In Autoritratto in Pantofole (Self-Portrait in Slippers) (all works cited, 2024), a photograph of a pinned and mounted butterfly is partially covered by another framed work, which has been flipped over to display only the back, where we find an inscription of the signature, year, and title. Under there, hidden from the public, the artist told me, was a photo of himself sniffing one of his slippers. Likewise, in Io e Augustin in spiaggia a Pachino (Sicilia) (Augustin and I on the Beach in Pachino [Sicily]), a photograph depicts two shrimp lying on a table, looking at each other like two lovers after having made forbidden love. Their bodies are modestly covered by a flipped-over framed work that is itself partly obscured by a small painting depicting a branch. An entire wall was devoted to large-scale paintings. These were dominated by heavy tones, reverberating with a romantic, nineteenth-century nostalgia. As he did with the photographs, the artist here superimposed these works with other images—in these cases, photographs of brambles taken at night with a flash. “I let myself go in painting; for me it is a way to flee this prison I have in my head,” Benassi said. That is, it is as if, with the brush, he was trying to avoid the struggle with reality that is manifested through the use of the flash, which imposes a new light, obliterating any other—even the sun of a springtime afternoon, as in his most recent color photographs. But the flash is also a dramaturgic element of performance. During INNO (Hymn), Benassi’s most recent live performance, created with musicians Lamante and Michele Lombardelli, the artist orchestrated his chaos as usual. He waded into the audience, raised his arm and took a picture, using the flash. This act, as he repeated it, seemed like a blessing, but one that also blinded and alienated his subjects. He then passed the camera to his assistant, who continued to take pictures, as the artist began playing on the waiting instruments, inviting others to play along, and finally smashed the guitar with a few blows of an axe. The performance concluded with Lamante singing, a cappella, the hymn that gave the exhibition its title: “Pain for a moment, then only love. Save yourself. Saved.” The lights came on. We were all safe, on the other side of the barricade. Irony of fate, it was November 6, the day of the American election and Trump’s victory. Translated from Italian by Marguerite Shore.",

         "Among the paintings on view in Dana Schutz’s exhibition “The Island” is one called To Have a Head, 2017. This could have made a good alternate title for the show, as heads—and questions about how it feels to have or be one—are prominent in most of the fifteen paintings and five drawings on display. The painting shows a figure in a posture of despair, hands on head. The protagonists of other works appear anxious, burdened, or uncomfortable—but at the same time they also look funny or absurd. The recent group portrait The Arbiters, 2023, shows some outsize potato heads, while Face Eater, 2004, one of Schutz’s best known and most hilarious portraits, is a head in the process of eating itself. Schutz’s free, straightforward figuration struck a nerve in the early 2000s, and its goofy and cartoonish images of modern life and its easy art-historical references—such as a print of Courbet’s L’origine du monde (The Origin of the World), 1866, on the T-shirt worn by the figure in Daughter, 2000—inspired a younger generation of painters. The fast and energetic look of Schutz’s paintings was part of their appeal; it always seemed as if the artist, inspired by an idea, just did it, in a quick and confident act of creation. As a small retrospective, with works ranging from 2000 to 2024, this show offers an opportunity to compare the artist as she is today with her former self and to see how her style has developed. In recent years she has sought dialogue with painters of the past, resulting in some monumental (and relatively traditional) multifigure compositions, among them Dear Painter, 2023, which reflects on the act of painting a model. The artist’s engagement with the European tradition of group portraiture, or with biting scenes from the Neue Sachlichkeit (which seem relevant for our own grotesque era) resulted in more complicated compositions, as in Mountain Group, 2018. Heavier impasto brushwork marks a difference from the flatter works made earlier. With this turn to art history, the burden of painting’s past weighs more heavily on Schutz’s shoulders. Her later paintings appear serious and complex but also a bit stiff and heavy-handed. The storytelling tends to take over the painting, as in The Arbiters, where five figures gesticulate and argue, leaving the viewers to put the pieces together. Suddenly Schutz is not that unique, but one among many painters trying to cut a piece of the cake. Observing this conundrum shines a light on how meaning was transmitted in Schutz’s earlier works, those made up until around 2006, when it came through a more direct and immediate evocation of a feeling. Even when there were hints at narrative, as in Face Eater or in Google, 2006, where we see the artist bent over a computer screen, a unifying energy sweeps through the painting, giving it a kind of lightness and tying it together. The shifts in paint application are smooth, and the implied story is a relative thing—not the main point of the painting. Looking at these paintings, one gets the feeling that the artist hit it just right. Such a talent is probably not something a painter can really own, at least over time.

         "Part of an artist’s job is to fill up spaces. Whether they respond to the character of a given space ingeniously or confrontationally, it dictates the presentation of their works. Mathias Poledna is the rare artist who modifies space with such precision that he makes the room look as though it was designed especially for his art. In this case, the large main hall of the Halle für Kunst Steiermark was cut in half lengthwise by an imposing freestanding wall that reached almost to the ceiling, with gaps at both ends. When you entered, the room was empty and brightly lit. Facing you was an entry into another room, hidden behind another, smaller wall. On the other side of the large wall was a solitary bench. Before long, the light went out theatrically and the wall became a screen for a 35-mm film projection. Behind the bench was an entrance to a small room where the formidable-looking projector and an even bigger film looper were placed like sculptures to be admired. Walking around the large wall and through the entrance behind the smaller wall, you found a semicircular room filled with natural light, containing only a bench and an impressive handwoven carpet, Örtagården (The Herb Garden), 1929, designed by Swedish textile artist Märta Måås-Fjetterström. Downstairs in the basement hung a set of archival photographs from an Italian car manufacturer, to which Poledna gave the collective title Untitled (circa 1963–1972), 2022. In the center of the room, a vintage Michelin tire tube, still in its original wrapping, presumably from the same period as the photographs, was suspended in midair (Untitled, 2022). It is difficult to convey how utterly meticulous the exhibition felt, down to the way wall labels were printed (Poledna had temporarily changed the graphic identity of the institution so that everything fit the aesthetic of his work). For instance, half of the large hall was left empty just to create an approach to the side where the film was shown; the benches and works were placed to echo each other and generate the sense of an intensely controlled environment. Such details transformed the entire building into an optimal apparatus for viewing his show. Its centerpiece was a film, My Favorite Shop, 2024. It starts with a pounding beat, reverberating through the building, which presently turns into a dance tune. A model dressed in a simple and loose-fitting dress emerges from the dark. It’s a catwalk. She strolls in and out of the frame, comes back in clad in the same dress but in a different color: black, purple, white, green, red. Then she is joined by a second model, wearing the same kind of dress. The camerawork is mobile, sometimes getting so close to the models that the entire shot is filled by the color of the fabric. The figures are totally affectless, even when the second model, dressed in striking red, struts by holding a realistic severed head of a bearded man by its hair, like a handbag. After about ten minutes the film ends, the music fades, the lights turn on. The film invites and rewards repeated viewing without disclosing its meaning. A young woman holding a severed head immediately evokes Judith or Salome, but how does that fit with a fashion show? And how were the film, the 1920s Swedish modernist carpet, and the vintage Michelin tire connected? As with previous works by Poledna, a dense web of references and complex thinking was evident, and the backstory of each element was discussed in the long text by curator Sandro Droschl and assistant curator Caro Feistritzer. But the point of it all remained elusive, though one sensed the presence of an underlying logic. Perhaps that’s enough. Those references are not the main reason why I enjoy Poledna’s works. Rather, I admire his insatiable and unattainable striving for perfection and complete control. Poledna’s works, reticent and elegant, contain no hint of affectation or exaggeration. But the level of precision required to do what he does is utterly insane. And I find the exactitude exhilarating.",

         "In his ninth solo exhibition at Galerie Max Hetzler, Jeremy Demester once again put the focus on a sublime and mystical nature. The artist, who has lived mostly in Benin for the past ten years, was born in 1988 in Digne-les-Bains, France, and grew up there. He described the ten pieces in this fairly intimate show, “Shepherds’ Play,” as forming “fragment by fragment the memory of a childhood spent in Provence.” If his pictures revisit places of his childhood, then they do so across a considerable distance in time and geography, from a very different scenery and cultural setting. It is this distance that makes Demester’s art a kind of Proustian recherche, an archaeology of atmospheres, temperaments, and states of being. His paintings devise subtly abstract translations for such landscapes of memory—while typically anchoring them in specific places. The titles of three medium-format works in acrylic on copper, Passage de Barles, Visite de l’ange et du chien à Archail (Visit of the Angel and the Dog to Archail), and Passage des Dourbes, all from 2024, for instance, point to villages around Digne-les-Bains. The titular locale in the large-format Le Tremble à Courbons, 2024, is a borough of Digne that is apparently home to a prominent trembling or quaking aspen, a tree whose leaves respond to the softest wind with a characteristic rustling. Demester often bases his motifs on such vivid sensory experiences, when, as he writes, “the movements of the air give rhythm and voice to the branches and leaves of the aspens; to the wild grasses and thistles, the air is filled with the powerful scent of rosemary and slate earth. I paint these moments when the wind seems to take the whole landscape in its hand to throw it in my face.” Painting on copper, an old-master technique that Demester has practiced for some time, endows the pictures with a special radiance. The copper ground occasionally flashes through the paint layers; in Passage de Barles and Passage des Dourbes, for example, it combines with warm ochers and earth tones. These two are traversed by flickering and undulating vertical bands of color: reddish browns, smoky blues, luminous yellows. The intertwined bright and nocturnal tones evoke the experience of gazing into the campfire after a long hike, representing “what I see in the flames, of this nature that has been imprinted on me,” as Demester puts it. Le Tremble à Courbons speaks a similar visual language: The aspen billows like a flame, its furrowed bark extending into the branches in tapered blue wavy lines interwoven with sinuous white leaves. Essence Concrète, 2024, strikes a sharply different note: The octagon of shimmering copper avoids all anecdotal specificity; its topmost surface is painted in an almost monochrome reddish beige. Under changing light, the meditative color space created with special lacquers reveals surprisingly varied hues, including cerulean. In this way, its sensory abstractness gestures toward manifold natural shades. The painterly execution and, in some instances, the titles of five watercolors enhanced with pastels suggest Demester’s studies in Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, as in Étude d’après C. Monet, 2023, and Étude d’après l’école de Pont-Aven, 2023. For works of this type, Demester first paints in dark-toned watercolors to produce fields bounded by rounded edges, then elaborates the shapes with dry pastels in luminous colors to create enigmatic landscapes bathed in darkness. The dense and delicate lines and spots celebrate the imagined vitality of an imagined nature on the verge of resolving into abstraction. Translated from German by Gerrit Jackson.",

         "Amy, Pam, Judie, Kate: In her “Black Mirror” paintings, 2009–12, included in her recent exhibition “Distant Lover 2009–2024,” Monica Majoli commemorated former lovers and partners of yesteryear in small-format portraits and nude figure studies—shadowy depictions staged in a theatrical light inspired by Georges de la Tour. The story behind these works is unusual: The Californian painter invited women she had dated ten or fifteen years earlier for portrait sessions—to paint them and, in so doing, conjure up once more the intensity of their relationships. The women appear before us, exposed, self-absorbed, their faces obscured, exuding an air of melancholy, which presumably says something above all about the artist and her losses—about a closeness, an intimacy that is no longer; loves that have come and gone and that the oil paintings bring back briefly to life. Majoli, who was born in 1963, evokes all this with a dramatic chiaroscuro one might easily have dismissed as kitsch. She pairs the portraits with highly abstract depictions of the bedroom in her Los Angeles home, which is decorated with black mirrors. Rendered as dark-toned color fields, they lend the project a less sentimental tone than that of the figure paintings. A larger segment of the exhibition was dedicated to watercolor woodcut transfers featuring posing men. The motifs are drawn from 1970s gay men’s magazines such as Blueboy and Olympus, recalling a time when people in the US queer community were starting to become more open about their sexual orientation but when HIV was still beyond the horizon. It’s the same era German viewers recently saw reflected in “Andy Warhol: Velvet Rage and Beauty” at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, which focused on the artist’s queer identity. Majoli’s large-format nudes are not quite as explicit as Warhol’s, but the naked young men look like they must be indulging in erotic fantasies; some emulate the ideal beauty of ancient archetypes. Majoli’s emphatically flat woodcuts downplay spatial depth while abstracting from their photographic sources. We never see the men in action, though there is no shortage of genitalia, executed in bland pastel hues. In fact, these models in warm-toned domestic environments are stylized figures depicted with a formal aesthetic that brings, say, Henri Matisse to mind. Like the women’s portraits, these works strike a plaintive note, grieving, in this instance, for poster boys from those men’s magazines, who may have died of AIDS in the ’80s. It is not unusual anymore for an exhibition to pay homage to queer identity, as this one did. What sets Majoli’s oeuvre apart is the autobiographical angle from which she approaches eroticism and sexuality as well as the vulnerability they reveal. In that sense, the show not only had a confessional dimension, but it also amounted to a personal work of mourning. Meanwhile, through the artist’s staging of her memories of past girlfriends, the show emphasized that the individual and personal experience come before all collective identity. The “Black Mirror” works are riskier because they are more intimate than the ones with anonymous or pseudonymous models who appear in a more decorative manner. The avowedly subjective dimension was what lent the exhibition its emotional depth. Translated from German by Gerrit Jackson.",

         "As I write, Georgians are fighting on the streets of Tbilisi after their pro-Russian government suspended its bid to join the European Union. The Russian—sometime Soviet—empire still casts a long shadow over Georgia, a country whose political identity may be stifled, but not its cultural life. Among the artists who resisted Soviet cultural uniformization and censorship was Sergei Parajanov (1924–1990), whose wildly original cinema has yet to be fully understood. In such masterpieces as Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (1964), The Color of Pomegranates (1969), and Ashik Kerib (1988), Parajanov struggled against Soviet stereotypes to unveil the originality and strangeness of Caucasian folk culture. Today, we see how the otherness shown in his films often verged on “queerness”: Characters change genders and identities; men experience moments of unparallelled intimacy with each other. Parajanov was imprisoned in 1973 for alleged homosexuality (today he is believed to have been bisexual). Incarceration inspired what (aside from the films themselves) might be the best work in this exhibition: a series of drawings depicting life in the Gulag, with the violence and beatings he experienced, but also celebrating the male beauty of his cellmates. Here too are costumes for his films. Ethnographic research into the folk cultures of peoples such as the ancient Transcarpathian Hutsuls or Armenian Apostolic Christians resulted in drawings, collages, and assemblages that are similar in appearance to Joseph Cornell’s shadow boxes. At Zachęta, these are shown alongside excerpts from Parajanov’s films—including censored and previously unseen fragments, often of intense sensuality, both homoerotic and otherwise—and works by young, queer, contemporary artists from Georgia and Ukraine, both places where he lived. Uta Bekaia, from Georgia, is the most literally immersed in the world of his great compatriot, creating costumes and staging tableaux with mannequins wearing exaggerated, even more flamboyant versions of Parajanovian costumes. Bekaia’s work is a ravishing celebration of the approach to color, fabric, and textures typical of the people of the Caucasus, made even more excessive, like a queered fairy tale. I was most taken by the work of nonbinary Ukrainian artist Jan Bačynsjkyj/Yana Bachynska, who makes large fabric reliefs with narratives about loss, with patchwork humanoid creatures made of materials associated with the countryside: ripped doilies, folk-patterned fabrics, woven baskets, and the artist’s own clothes. They conjure uncanny characters, often pointing to religious orthodoxy as in Queer Priest, 2023, but rendered strange and ridiculous, like scarecrows intended to be planted in Ukrainian territory to provoke Russian soldiers. I also admired the film by Brazilian-Armenian Rosana Palazyan, A Story I Never Forgot, 2013, which traces her grandmother’s journey, following the Armenian genocide, from Konya in Turkey to Thessaloniki in Greece and finally to Rio de Janeiro. This simple, eerie film, parts of it filmed from an embroidery that we see being made in a circular frame, juxtaposes childlike aesthetics and brutal content, which then reaches a hopeful conclusion. For Akinto, 2023, David Apakidze produced AI-generated images of so-called kintos, street vendors in old Tbilisi, who were often thought to be of ambiguous sexuality and are now emblems during Tbilisi Pride; he shows them holding and kissing each other openly in the ancient surroundings. This work seemed simplistic, but perhaps it is a necessary expression of post-Soviet artists’ freedom in the face of the homophobia and anti-LGBTQI+ laws still prevalent in Georgia. In any case, the juxtaposition of Parajanov’s work with that of younger artists seems justified, since they are all striving, as he did, for artistic and sexual freedom. Unlike them, Parajanov weaves his influences together into a domain of private obsessions, where idiosyncrasy, whether cultural or sexual, reigns definitively.",

         "“The machine’s danger to society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes of it.” This quote by cybernetician Norbert Wiener jumped out at me shortly after my visit to L. N. Tallur’s solo show “Neti-Neti: Glitch in the Code.” While the advent of artificial intelligence might have spooked some creative practitioners, calling into question their very raison d’être, Tallur is most certainly not one of them. Instead, the artist actively courts and embraces AI, interrogating the possibilities and perils of machine intelligence. The titles of several of his exhibited sculptures and installations, such as Data Weave, Deep Learning PI two (Portable intelligence-two), and Code Keepers (all works 2024), attest to this fascination with data and software. Tallur has always evinced a keen interest in machines, often blurring the boundaries between handcrafted and machine-made objects. He has created his own quirky contraptions, as evident in shows such as “Chromatophobia” at Nature Morte in 2011. But it was the pandemic, he told me, that afforded him the opportunity and time to explore digital tools and delve more deeply into the world of machine learning and recurrent neutral networks. Now he flits between the physical and digital worlds as effortlessly as he shuttles between his homes in India and South Korea. Scanning images of traditional Indian sculpture and religious iconography, he manipulates them digitally, pushing the software to the brink till a malfunction occurs. He then gives this glitch three-dimensional material form. The arresting patina-hued bronze sculpture Glitch Tandava, for instance, had its source in the divine dance of the Hindu god Shiva. Only the dancer appeared to be stuttering in his movements, his limbs caught in a freeze-frame. In Code Keepers, the artist photographed an antique bronze sculpture he found in a flea market, inverting, distorting, and conjoining its features, before casting the result in bronze. In Fire Wall, stylized, symbolic hand gestures, evocative of traditional Indian dance movements, bookend an elongated sculpture—a body that appeared to have been stretched out like chewing gum to form a bronze wall. The bulbous figure in Data Weave looks like a mash-up of Gandhi with the Star Wars Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, while the boxy, angular, iridescent statue in Digital Sage appears to be an amalgam of a Transformer robot with a Hindu deity. But Tallur’s real experimentation with AI was in evidence in a side gallery, in the three-part installation Deep Learning PI two (Portable intelligence-two). Much like an archive, it consists of a number of boxes and drawers that can be opened to reveal images and small, scaled-down versions of his earlier works—but with a twist. Tallur has trained an AI to produce art in the style of his own previous works, made over the course of his twenty-year association with Nature Morte. The back-and-forth interaction between man and machine led to the generation by the AI of new and unexpected ideas. If AI is indeed the future, Tallur’s experimentation shows us how to navigate it with dexterity.",

         "Is it possible to keep a diary and reveal nothing but the diary itself? I couldn’t help thinking that the thirty-five paintings in Au Hoi Lam’s exhibition “Painting, Its Reasons to Be”—hung closely in a row that ran along the entire gallery—work in just that way. Instead of revealing much about their creator’s life, the works demonstrate her way of thinking. This was Au’s first hometown show in eight years. It comprised works made between 2003 and 2024, including two recent series, “Contemplating in a Hermetic House,” 2020–, and “Prime Number or Imperfect Square,” 2024, the latter made on drawing boards used in local schools. Most of Au’s works are made by drawing in pencil on dried acrylic paint. The result often resembles a gridded school notebook filled with marks and notations. A few pieces, however, use the graphite and paint to create more atmospheric painterly touches, and some synthesize the two modes. But the pencil-on-acrylic works stand out. 86400 Seconds of a Day (86400 = 294 x 294 – 36), 2009, for example, consists of an uneven hand-drawn grid with a doily-like edge, presumably consisting of 86,400 squares or at least giving the impression of that large number—I did not count them! Each square has been dotted with a pastel shade of blue, green, yellow, lavender, or pink paint, with the colors running in a diagonal pattern. I assume she drew from left to right and top to bottom, as the “squares” become more cramped and bend as the grid approaches the bottom-right edge. Does the piece mark time’s passage? Or meditate on time through labor? Dotting a color takes only a second, but preparing for the act takes far more time. Eleven 365 Days (365 x 11 = 73 x 55), 2009, bears a formal kinship to 86400 Seconds in that it, too, consists of diagonal stripes of pastel color set in a grid that marks a span of time. However, its drawn structure is much more precise and even. Its appearance is bright and rainbowlike with its colors quite apparent, in contrast to the predominance of graphite that creates a gray-silver aura in 86400 Seconds. In both instances, the work’s hue projects something other than a sense of labor: a childlike joy. And yet the rigid repetition also conjures boredom. But is that not itself a sense of time passing slowly? “I once wanted,” according to the artist’s poetic texts in an accompanying leaflet, “to see eleven years in a single glance.” Au shares something with On Kawara and Roman Opalka, who also marked time with repetition. But while those Conceptual painters established oeuvres that convey an existential quality, Au’s work does not seem to be motivated by a singular organizing drive. Rather, her art is drawn from inspirations that feel more quotidian and mercurial. For instance, she turns the outline of Hong Kong island into a gridded puzzle in the “Hermetic House” pieces, and an homage to the prime number takes the form of imperfect squares, which could in turn be interpreted as a nod to Josef Albers. A door emblazoned with the number 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square protests, reminds her of a classroom in her old school; 45 is the number of years she has lived. Maybe what really interests her is numbers. At least they don’t lie. Au, who has a master’s in philosophy, is certainly interested in truth. But her touch displays a different sort of truth than numbers ever can.",

         "A punk rocker turned multidisciplinary artist, Yuko Mohri grew up in Kanagawa, Japan, a city without a contemporary art museum but with edgy music venues and avant-garde cinemas. She went from singing in a band to creating a DIY magnetic organ—a pseudo-perpetual-motion machine that repeatedly fed back a magnetic force to activate a motor and generate sound with a microphone—for her BFA project at Tama Art University in Tokyo in 2004. Twenty years later, Mohri is still harnessing invisible forces. She constructed two sound-and-kinetic art installations for her solo show in Japan’s pavilion at last year’s Venice Biennale. One installation employed decomposing fruit wired and digitally filtered to generate power for electric lights and to create acoustic sounds through speakers and on a drum. The other used a system of hoses, funnels, buckets, and plastic bags to simulate a DIY response to a leaky ceiling, with both projects keeping the space in a state of flux. “On Physis,” Mohri’s first large-scale survey in Japan, features eleven works shown in relationship to modernist pieces from the Artizon Museum’s collection. The fifth in the museum’s annual “Jam Sessions,” combining pieces from the collection with works by a contemporary artist, the show was three years in the making, with the artist researching the collection, selecting pieces, and analyzing the gallery’s architecture before creating her site-specific works. Taking its title from the Greek term for nature, the engaging exhibition reflects the artist’s ongoing interest in creating sound and movement through interconnected actions. Here, she paired two new versions of Decomposition, 2021—the Venice piece using fruit to generate organ-like sounds and pulsating illuminations—with Georges Braque’s Two Pears and a Peach, 1924, an expressively painted still life displayed in a sloping hallway that Mohri designed to lead viewers to a platform overlooking the rest of the show. On this stage, she juxtaposed Constantin Brancusi’s The Kiss, 1907–10, with a new iteration of Calls, 2013–, a fork dangling on a ribbon above two magnets that cause it to swirl and ping—or metaphorically kiss—a nearby wineglass. Piano Solo: Belle-Île, 2021–24, is an installation featuring an upright self-playing piano programmed to activate its keys via microphones catching recorded sounds from a projected seascape scene. The video was shot at the site where Claude Monet realized his nearby painting, Belle-Île, Rain Effect, 1886. But the exhibition’s pièce de résistance, The Flipping-apparatus, Three Veils, 2018–, is an installation of kinetic works centered on Marcel Duchamp’s From or by Marcel Duchamp or Rrose Sélavy (Box in a Valise), Series B, 1952. Replicating The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, 1915–23, with a mechanized combination of fabricated and readymade parts, Mohri laid out The Large Glass on two sides of a wall. Nine magnetic coils represent the bachelors, plastic funnels replace the parasols, and a silver brush rotates over a stainless steel rendition of the Oculist Witnesses to regulate the amount of electricity running through a hole in the wall. On the other side of the wall, the installation employs scanners to capture the bride’s veil and project it onto suspended computer screens while nine transistor radios transmit sounds resembling raindrops falling. Another large installation featuring one of her earliest and most exhibited works, I/O, 2011–, presents a cascading roll of paper suspended from the ceiling in dialogue with three Henri Matisse drawings of a woman with a ruffled collar. Activated by the conditions of the space, the paper brushes over the floor, picking up traces of dust that are scanned and converted into random electrical signals operating flopping feather dusters, an unfurling roll of toilet paper, an open-and-closing Venetian blind, and a sound-emitting xylophone. Influenced by Duchamp’s way of using everyday objects and John Cage’s way of letting ambient sound contribute to the performance, Mohri’s installations and compositions seem most felicitous when she can leave them alone and let them play freely.",

         "Peter Alwast has spoken of wanting to combine “different systems of representation that never ultimately reconcile to create a stitched-up version of reality.” These systems have ranged across video, abstract and representational painting, drawing, and computer graphics. However, the Polish-born Australian artist’s latest show, “The Imaginarium,” is all painting: seventeen works in oil, oil stick, and occasionally distemper, applied to the coarse linen supports he prefers. Some of the paintings continue Alwast’s infusion of utopian aspiration or postcard romanticism with a touch of astringency. Two pictures in the first room of the gallery hint at the domesticated tropical environs of Alwast’s teenage home on the Queensland Gold Coast, known colloquially as Glitter City. In the six-foot-square Smoking By The Pool, 2023–24, a boulder-like head (a self-portrait?) exhales a languorous curl of smoke that ascends over a silhouetted palm tree, surrounded by a flat blue pool, other rocky heads, and a rising moon. Shifting between the past and the present, the second canvas’s title, The Balcony, 2024, emulates that of Édouard Manet’s famous 1868–69 painting, one of the artist’s favorites. But Alwast’s picture supplants Manet’s bourgeois friends with a flattened view from a balcony populated only by potted palms in silhouette and faux-Baroque lights sheltered from a miniature landscape of burning buildings and bomb-like explosions of pink paint. Elsewhere, Together, 2024, depicts the glowing embers of a firework descending in a gray haze, suggesting the atomized dissipation of collective celebration. Other pictures more openly reflect Alwast’s interest in new technologies. Screen, 2022–23, is a naive-style depiction of a technologically advanced car interior seen from the back seats, with white touch screens attached to the front seats painted in luminous green and blue. Up front, a shadowed child’s finger touches a dash screen as though the child is the author of loose strokes of pink and blue paint forming the arch of the car’s windshield. This image, combined with eerily glowing colors in a darkened space, casts the contemporary automobile as literally autonomous: an intimate, virtualized capsule entirely cut off from the external world. Two paintings gesture to current hot-button political issues. In Guards, 2024, dark-hooded sentries, deliberately recalling Philip Guston’s Klan figures, stand in swirling fog at a border of glowing white light, evoking the risks faced by refugees at border crossings worldwide. The large canvas Landscape Problem, 2023, is divided into two horizontal zones, with a lower portion of abstract forms suggesting geological strata and an upper section depicting a drab landscape sparsely dotted with dwellings and obscured by plumes of noxious-looking vapor. Although the identity of this murky cloud is ambiguous, Extraction, 2023, a study for Landscape Problem, points to the destruction of Australia’s environment by an economy deeply dependent on mining for all manner of climate-changing resources. While this show is, overall, less gnomic than Alwast’s previous explorations of relations and dissonances between old and new media, it continues his refusal to countenance era-defining breaks between modern and technologically inclined contemporary art. The artist has consistently inscribed respect for historical precursors of modernity within his reflections on the challenges of contemporary life.",
